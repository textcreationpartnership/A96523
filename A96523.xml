            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It's ſufficiently known that men of this Leaven have an evil eye againſt all Schools of Learning, and therefore beſpatter and calumniate them, that they may more eaſily make a prey of their Revenues. This was the Diveliſh deſign of <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> to overthrow Schools of Learning, and rob them of their maintenance; and this was a ſubtle Stratagem uſed by him to hinder the ſucceſſion of Miniſters: But all ſober minded perſons (who have their eyes in their heads) ſee, and cannot but acknowledge the ſingular and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of Publick Nurſeries of Learning, Maugre all the Aſperſions and out-crys of thoſe falſe tongues ſet on Fire of Hell. From theſe places of Learning have come forth a Noble Army of Martyrs, <hi>viz. Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Bradford, Tindall, Philpot, &amp;c.</hi> who have reſiſted Popery unto Blood, and ſealed unto the truth of the Proteſtant Religion with their own Blood.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> can produce a large Catalogue of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Champions for the Truth, ſome whereof were <hi>Bradwardin, Wickliffe, Jewell, Fox, Jo: Reynolds, Hooker, Ayry, Crackenthorp, Field, Lake, Hackwell, Benefield, Bolton, Pemble, &amp;c.</hi> Our publick Profeſſors have been an Ornament unto that Chair, and have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Rome, Racovia, Munſter, &amp;c.</hi> Their Names are like precious Oyntment poured forth, leaving a ſweet ſavour behinde them, <hi>viz. Peter Martyr, Humfred, Abbot, Holland, Prideaux, Sanderſon, Hoyle:</hi> And the preſent Profeſſor, (though I conceal his name) deſerves an Honorable mention, whoſe Parts and Graces adorned with ſo great Humility, render him an uſeful Inſtrument for Publick Good.</p>
                  <p>It's worth our Obſervation, That in former times ſtill God raiſed up Men of Heroick Courage and Invincible Reſolution, to lop off and fear the Hydra of Hereſies, and defend the truth againſt all Gain-ſayers. I ſhall onely make mention of ſome remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages within my own remembrance: When that novel upſtart Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Arminius, (novel I call it) (unleſs <hi>Arminius</hi> be <hi>Pelagius redivivus,</hi> and upon that account may plead more Antiquity) was broach'd when ſome (not all) Prelates countenanced thoſe Tenets,
<pb facs="tcp:116001:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> and preferred thoſe of that Perſwaſion to places of Preferment: How many then of the younger Students bent their Studies that way? Inſomuch as I have ſeen a Remonſtrance of Parliament above thirty years ago, declaring, <hi>That the ſtudy of Arminianiſm was the ready way to preferment, and the Arminians were compared to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.</hi> For my own obſervation, I have for the moſt part apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Arminian to be compounded of a Jeſuit and a formal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, That ſo by the one he may ingratiate himſelf thus, by broaching pleaſing Doctrines of General Redemption, Free Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by the help of the other, he may carry on his Deſigns with more ſubtlety: It cannot be deny'd, but twenty years ago <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had a great Harveſt in both Univerſities, yet in both God raiſed up worthy Champions, to oppoſe and confute all thoſe rotten Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: To inſtance onely according to my own Perſonal knowledge.

                  <p>But I proceed no further in this Argument: By what I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from others (to whom I ſubſcribe) that ſince Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was profeſt, there was never a Collection of more Godly, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and Learned Divines, then in this preſent Century. Yet I am far from excuſing or extenuating the Animoſities, Heart-diviſions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, unſeemly Habits, ſelf intereſts, carnal Policies, unwarrantable ſeparations, and that Latitude which many take unto themſelves now adays: The good old Puritan would not take an Inch formerly, where many now venture to take an Ell. I heartily wiſh a Reformation tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; impartial, that what we condemn in others, we may avoid each one in himſelf.

Let's all labor as one man to be found in the Faith, and holy in life, ſo that Hereſies, Blaſphemies, and all forts of profaneneſs, may be abominated and extirpated. And let it be our endeavor <hi>to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace:</hi> So <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> that according to thoſe Propheſies (the accompliſhment whereof we daily expect) <hi>We may all worſhip the Lord with one conſent, that the</hi>

                     <hi>Lord may be one, and his name one:</hi> And let us never forget that the vows God are upon us, (which we ought to our power to endeavor to keep inviolably) in that Solemn National Covenant (which was made in a day of diſtreſs) with our hands lifted up to the moſt high God. Let not that Solemn Oath be accounted as an Almanack out of date, leſt the Lord ſend a Sword to avenge the quarrel of a broken Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:

                     <hi>and joyn in affinity with the people of theſe abominations?</hi> After Oathes, Covenants, Days of Humiliation; and after ſo many ſignal Deliverances, ſhall we again hancker after ſuperſtitious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, a formal Service Book, a Lordly Prelacy, unwarrantable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, Schiſms, Machiavilian Policies, ſelf-ſeeking Intereſts?

                     </p>
                     <p>1. In reſpect of God. God hath a tender care of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and this muſt be the end of the whole creation. And above all, the reaſonable creature muſt act in every thing for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt end, the glory of God. Now wherein is God more glorified, then in the converſion of ſoules. Its ſaid, <hi>John 15. 8. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruit.</hi> And amidſt variety of good fruit, this is one of the moſt ſweet and acceptable to God, to pluck a ſinner out of the Devils ſnare, and convert him to Jeſus Chriſt. And this ſhould be the ſole end and deſigne of every one that enters into the Miniſteriall function to promote the glory of God in ſaving of their own ſoules, and thoſe that heare them: when this end is firſt in thine eye, and accompanied with a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious ſedulity in the exerciſe of the meanes, thou mayeſt expect the bleſſing of God crowning thy endeavours with good ſucceſſe. And ſuch a perſon is a man of wiſdome, who is ſo highly honoured by God as to be an inſtrument to convert but one ſoule unto God. <note place="margin">Arg. 2. <hi>In reſpect of ſoules.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument is in reſpect of the object, ſoules, and that rationall ſoules endowed with noble faculties, the underſtanding and the will the very breath of God, <hi>Gen. 2. 7.</hi> The peculiar crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> not by propagation, it's God that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſpirit of man within him, <hi>Zech. 12. 1.</hi> And God is <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus a quo &amp; ad quem</hi> both, <hi>Eccl. 12. 7. The ſpirit ſhall returne unto God that gave it.</hi> The ſoule is immateriall and ſpirituall, a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly borne being, not made of the earth as the body was, but <hi>infuſed by creation, and created by infuſion:</hi> and though the body moulder into <note place="margin">A nima creando infunditur, &amp; inſundendo creatur. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> duſt and ſee corruption, yet the ſoule runs parallel with the longeſt line of eternity. Men and Divels banding together cannot kill the ſoule. And hereupon againſt perplexing feares and cares, Chriſt gives a ſeaſonable caution, <hi>Matth. 10. 28. Feare not them, which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule, but rather feare him, which is able to deſtroy both body and ſoule in Hell.</hi>

To preach, pray, conſerre, &amp; meditate is the Miniſters duty, but the ſucceſſe is the work of God. We are earthen veſſels encompaſſed with infirmities, <hi>men of like paſſions,</hi> but in the weakneſſe of the inſtrument, the ſtrength of God more eminently appeares; and God works by weake meanes, men of meane preſence and low eſteeme amongſt men, <hi>that no fleſh may glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n his preſence,</hi> and all the honour may redound to God. But the Lord had never any ſpeciall ſervice but he raiſed up perſons of ſuitable ſpirits for the performance of it. <hi>Bezaleel and Aholiab</hi> were filled with wiſdome for building of the tabernacle: God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up the ſpirits of <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zacharie, Zerubbabel</hi> for the reedifying of the temple. And now adaies God raiſeth up men of heroicall ſpirits both of the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> to carry on the worke of reformation both in Church and State, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all the hoſtile oppoſitions, plots and projects of Sanballats and Tobiahs, even all Jeſuiticall Malignantfactions, which are the Peſts and Gangrenes of the kingdome, Remora's and obſtructions of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. That propheſy doth afford many hopes againſt in any feares, <hi>Dan. 9. 25. The ſtreet ſhall be built againe, and the walls in troublous times.</hi> Thus then I argue. To conquer potent enemies, to ſubdue places of great ſtrength, and reduce them to outward obedience, is an argument of wiſdome in the conquerours: but to ſubdue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly affections, to conquer mens ſpirits, to winne ſoules unto Chriſt, this muſt be a higher piece of wiſdome indeed.</p>
                     <p>4. And laſtly, In reſpect of the reward, the excellency of this wiſdome ſhines forth more clearly. He that gaines a ſoule doth <note place="margin">Arg. 4. <hi>In reſpect of the reward.</hi>

                     <p>Its worth our obſervation, that our Saviour Chriſt, in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his Miniſtry, propounded many choice and excellent <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ver.</hi> 4. This was Chriſts familiar and accuſtomed method of Preaching.</p>
                     <p>One reaſon whereof is given for fulfilling of a Propheſie took out <note place="margin">R. 1. Ver. 35.</note> of <hi>Pſal. 78. 2. I will open my mouth in a Parable: I will utter dark ſayings of old; which we have heard, and known and our fathers have told us.</hi> Every Propheſie of Chriſt muſt be fulfilled in its ſeaſon; not an <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the word of God ſhall fail.</p>
                     <p>Another Reaſon why Chriſt ſpake in Parables, was for the obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">R. 2.</note> of the hearts of the wicked: God in judgement faſt cloſeth up, and hardneth the hearts of many ungodly perſons, who perſiſt in their impenitency, <hi>ver. 13.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Propheſie is cited by this Evangeliſt for a pregnant teſtimony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 69. 10. which words you ſhall finde ſyllabically repeated in the ſubſtantials thereof, <hi>Mark 4. 12.

Such a <hi>Crambe</hi> of repetitions, points out ſomething to be ſpecially regarded, as of more then ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
                     <p>A third Reaſon why Chriſt ſpake by Parables, might be to gain <note place="margin">R. 3.</note> an attentive audience. Chriſt ſpeaking Myſteries and Oracles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd the hearts of the Auditors, and made them inquiſitive after the Interpretation. Under hidden ſimilitudes there lay a myſterious meaning. Chriſt ſpake with authority, not as the <hi>Scrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The fourth and laſt Reaſon I ſhall mention, why Chriſt preacht <note place="margin">R. 4.</note> in <hi>Parables</hi> was, becauſe this was a more prevalent convincing way
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116001:47"/> of Preaching; when Reproofs or Exhortations are delivered in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables</hi> under the name of a third perſon, they gain more well-come and acceptable entertainment. Thus <hi>Nathan</hi> reproved <hi>David</hi> by a Parable of the Ewe-Lamb, and ſet his reproof home by a <hi>Proſopopeia; David</hi> hearing of the rich mans cruelty, in taking the poor mans Lamb, paſſeth ſentence of death upon him, and a fourfold reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>becauſe he had no pitty.</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

And thus ought the Miniſters of Chriſt to put in practice the moſt convincing way of Preaching, whether in a way of Mercy or Judgement; whether to come with a rod, or the ſpirit of meekneſs; whether to be <hi>Boanergeſſes,</hi> or <hi>Barnabaſſes.</hi> The moſt taking, winning way we muſt uſe (Provided always, that we make the word of God our juſt Standard and rule to go by) ſo that we may win ſouls unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now to draw nearer to the words: In this Chapter there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſundry, choice, and excellent Parables, as of the <hi>ſower,</hi> and <hi>the ſeed, a grain of muſtard-ſeed, leaven hid in three meaſures of meal, a caſting-net.</hi> I paſs from theſe, unto that which hath immediate refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto my Text, <hi>v.</hi> 44. The <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is a Treaſure, and the Scripture is that pretious ſeed where that Treaſure is to be found: Neither can every one finde it, or know the worth of it; It's a hidden Treaſure: The worth of the Goſpel is unknown by, and hidden from unbelievers: But the true Believer who ſindes it, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3.

                        <hi>A.</hi> Be ſilent, and murmur not, becauſe the Viſion ſeems to linger: Though ſence fails, yet let not Faith fail: It's the nature of Faith to wait for the execution of a promiſe, though it be long a coming: Faith hath a Prophetical vertue to ſee a Promiſe a great way off, and a Magnetical vertue to draw it near to it. So that if the Queſtion be moved to a Believer, What wilt thou do in theſe cloudy days? How wilt thou behave thy ſelf amidſt theſe dark paſſages of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? His anſwer is, I'le hope againſt hope, wait with Faith and Patience, and adhere unto the Word of God, and am reſolved not to let go my confidence.</p>
                     <p>However works of Providence may ſeem croſs, yet I'le depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth and faithfulneſs of God, I will wait and believe; though ſenſe be non-pluſſ'd, and I can ſee no reaſon why I ſhould wait on the Lord any longer. And here's the acting of Faith indeed in a true Believer, who reſolves, I will truſt my God, depend upon his Word, ſtay upon his Promiſes, rely upon his Attributes: <hi>Though he kill me, yet I will truſt in him,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> reſolved.</p>

                     <p>The Decree tarries not, nor ſeems to tarry: But according to the execution of the Decree, as it falls under our apprehenſions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations, it may ſeem to ſtay and linger: There is then no tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in God, but there is in the Creature. And though fleſh and blood cannot apprehend it, yet in tarrying God makes haſte.</p>
                     <p>You have here repreſented what Faith can do: <hi>David</hi> told <hi>Achiſh,</hi> when he was going to Battle, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee what thy ſervant can doe:</hi> Behold here what Faith through the ſtrength of God can do. Faith meets with many Obſtructions, and many Repulſes, yet it will fall on again: Faith meets with many delays, yet it is not querulous, it waits, it ſtays at the Fathers door, it will not be driven away. A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul believes God upon his word. God ſaith, <hi>The Viſion ſhall come;</hi> the Believer ſaith, <hi>I have enough,</hi> I'le here caſt anchor, it's good being here. The Promiſe is my ſtrong hold, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Locks, here my great ſtrength lies, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry. The Decree and Counſel of God never delays. God knows every minute of time, and gives a quick diſpatch unto his work. Faith believes it, though ſenſe cannot apprehend it, though (as I intimated before) the execution of the Decree, according to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effects and operations, may ſeem to delay. Here then is the tryal of our Faith and patience, and here's a word moſt ſeaſonable to Preach and practice in theſe days of <hi>Jacob's</hi> troubles, when the Viſion or the word ſeems to be dark and to tarry. I ſhall winde up all into one bottom, and from the ſcope and ſubſtance of them lay this one intire Doctrine for the foundation of my Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>The Anſwer which I ſhall give to this particular Inquiry, ſhall be compriſed in this deſcription: <hi>Waiting is a chearful ſubmiſſion of our wills to the will of God, whereby the ſoul reſts in hope, exerciſeth faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects with patience, and improves a diligent uſe of means for the obtaining of a good end:</hi> This deſcription is made of theſe five following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>

It would raviſh a Chriſtians heart to peruſe the Letters of Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> that holy Martyr, then whom (as I apprehend) never man wrote more ſweetly, and manifeſted more chearfulneſs under the Rod. To ruſh upon trouble, to be forced to ſufferings, and to ſay, I will bear it, becauſe I cannot otherwiſe chooſe; and to murmur and rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch and ſuch Inſtruments, this is not thank-worthy: But to make a vertue of neceſſity, and to bear thy Croſs chearfully, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in inward conſolations amidſt outward troubles; to have thine heart inlarged, though thy body be Impriſoned; to ſmile in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, becauſe God ſmiles upon thee, even when he beats thee, this is the glory of thy ſuffering: And whenſoever God hides his face from us, and clouds his gracious countenance, let us with all alacrity wait upon him, and learn to bear chearfully his dealings with us.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And the Sword is a puniſhment of their Pride, <hi>Amos 6, 7. Now therefore they ſhall go captive with the firſt that go captive, and the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of them that ſtretched themſelves ſhall be removed:</hi> Likewiſe the Sword is ſent for a puniſhment.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A fifth Judgement is Famine, and this is for contempt of the Word: <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in</hi>

                     </p>

                        <hi>that is full of ſheaves: therefore the flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift, and the ſtrong ſhall not ſtrengthen his force, neither ſhall the mighty deliver himſelf: neither ſhall he ſtand that handleth the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This counſel is commended to our practice, <hi>Jer. 9. 23. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> You have by what hath been ſayd a taſt of bitter fruites, ſome ſinnes and judgments ſet forth in their proper colours.

                     <p>The ſirſt reaſon ſhall be drawn from the excellencie of Iuſtice. And this will appeare in theſe particular reſpects.</p>
                     <p>It derives its Originall from God. Iuſtice is a communicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute flowing from the fountaine to the ſtreams, and government which is that maſter-wheel to ſet the motions of Iuſtice in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> receives prime honour and excellencie from divine Inſtitution. <hi>By me Kings raigne, and princes decree juſtice; by me Princes rule, and nobles, even all the Judges of the earth,</hi> Prov. 1. 15. 16. There's a <hi>jus divinum</hi> to warrant your honourable calling.</p>
                     <p>Iuſtice is excellent in reſpect of that incomparable ſuperexcellent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> price paid to make ſatisfaction to it and that was the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. It's true, that mercy is God's delight, It's above all his workes: mercy is ſwift pac'd; Iuſtice is ſlow pac'd, its chariot wheels drive heavilie. God was walking in the garden, when he went to paſſe ſentence on <hi>Adam:</hi> But he ranne to meet the Prodigall: here's a walking in point of judgment: but a running in point of mercy. Yet notwithſtanding Iuſtice will be no looſer. Mercy, Iuſtice, power, goodneſſe, obiquitie, &amp;c. are diverſly according to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities apprehended by us: yet they are all one in God. As God is mercifull: ſo he is juſt: Iuſtice muſt be ſatisfied <hi>per ſe aut per alium. Per ſe</hi> no man can, it muſt be done <hi>per alium,</hi> by a ſuretie. See <hi>Zech. 13. 7.

If the nurſe bee ſtarved, the child will bee ſtarved. Help them to encounter with the mighty, who refuſe to pay them their dues, becauſe they dare not give the Sacrament to them that are Scandalous, when as many times ſuch as they refuſe are fitter to go a grazing with <hi>Nebucadnezzar</hi> amongſt the beaſts of the field.

                     <p>To give a brief Paraphraſe on the Words: They are a Propheſie of the wonderful Redemption and Sanctification of ſinners by the Blood of Chriſt; It's ſaid; <hi>In that day, (i. e)</hi> a day of ſorrow and mourning for ſin, after they had been ſenſible of ſin, throughly humbled, felt the Gall and Wormwood, bewailed the bitterneſs of ſin, then joy comes after ſorrow: After the people had mourned for their ſins againſt Chriſt, then Chriſt waſheth them and cleanſeth them; when ſin hath been their greateſt ſorrow, then comes Chriſt, and is their greateſt joy. It is ſayd, <hi>A fountaine,</hi> O rich mercy! A foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>opened,</hi> O height of mercy! Free grace is offered, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſanctification by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: He is the inexhauſted fountaine; his blood is never drawn dry; neither is the Exchequer of his grace lockt up, ſo that none can come at it: but it's opened, and freely tendred <hi>for the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>&amp; the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> This fountaine is opened for them, they are waſht and cleanſed in the meritorious laver of Chriſt's blood. But why to them? <hi>v.</hi> 10. to them is promiſed the pouring of the ſpirit, and to them is Chriſt promiſed, they are ſenſible of the bitterneſs of ſin, they know how to reliſh the ſweetneſſe of a <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The fountaine is opened to them <hi>excluſive,</hi> and to them only; To others it's a Fountaine ſealed. Chriſt came to ſave his people. There are a peculiar people, whom Chriſt loveth, waſheth, ſaveth; and theſe are the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and Ieruſalem, <hi>(i e)</hi> the Children of God

                     <p>The Analogie holds good in theſe enſuing particular reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There's fullneſſe of water in a fountaine; No want at the well ſpring, the well head: There's the confluence of waters, there's
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116001:97"/> water in abundance; bring never ſo many veſſells, yet there's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to fill them.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There's a communication of the water of a fountaine to the ſtreams: So there's a communication of grace from Chriſt to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>John. 1. 16. Of his fulneſſe we receive, and grace for grace.</hi> The Head hath influence upon the members: From Chriſt we receive Union. <hi>John. 17. 21.</hi> So runs Chriſt's prayer, <hi>That they all may be one as thou fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> and heard that declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us, and truly our fellowſhip is with the father and his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now Chriſt derives vertue upon his members. Vertue flowes from him to cure his peoples maladies. Chriſt is the tree <hi>Rev. 22. 2. In the mid'ſt of the ſtreet of it, and on either ſide of the river was the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yeelded her fruit every moneth, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</hi> Chriſt's blood is diffuſive, and takes in all his people, not one member can be wanting. Look upon the fountaine and acknowledg Chriſt: whatever grace thou receiveſt is derivative from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A fountaine is ſaid to have liveing waters. Waters in a Pond are dead in a metaphoricall ſenſe: they ſtir not, they run not, they purge not: But waters in a fountaine are called liveing waters; they convey waters to the ſtreames, they are continually running from it: So in a peculiar manner <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a fountaine of liveing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Lord complaines, <hi>Jer. 2. 13. My people have committed two evills; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord Chriſt alone can give life unto his people. His blood is not dried up, it ſtands not ſtill, but is continually running and flowing to his members.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fountaine ſendeth forth pure waters. <hi>James 3. 11, 12. Doth a fountaine ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet water and bitter? Can the fig-tree (my Brethren) beare olive berries? either a vine, figs: ſo</hi>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:116001:98"/> 
                        <hi>can no fountaine both yeeld ſalt water and freſh.</hi> A fountaine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines no Garbidge nor Carrion. And moſt properly is Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a fountaine in regard of purity. Hee is purity it ſelfe, and purifieth his people: Ther's no Impurity in him: yet ſome impurity cleaves to his people as long as they are in this world. Theres ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of purity in him, in us only a meaſure; in him abſolute perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in us a mixture of ſinne, <hi>Rev. 22. 1. And hee ſhewed mee a pure river of water of life, cleare as Chriſtall, proceeding out of the throne of God and the Lamb.</hi> Such ſhall bee the Saints condition in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>5ly and laſtly. Chriſt is compared to a fountaine for perpetuity. A ſountaine continually ſupplieth the ſtreames, and is never drawn dry. Now Chriſt is a fountaine inexhauſted. Many goe with Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and returne, and wee meet with many men in the way going to fill their Pitchers: yet ther's enough for thee too. Bee ſenſible of thy want of Chriſt, entertaine a ſpiritual thirſt of him; and ther's an invitation for thee too. Though a thouſand come unto him with Pitchers, and goe away repleniſhed: yet ther's enough in the fountaine for millions more: Therefore goe not to creatures, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken empty ciſternes, ſtreames quite dried up, or running very low. But to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the inexhauſted fountaine; Millions of Pitchers fild cannot draw him dry: by communicating to them the fountaine looſeth not one drop of water.</p>
                     <p>2. But in the next place it comes to bee enquired; How <note place="margin">2.

                     <p n="1">1. Her's a cleanſing virtue in this fountaine to waſh the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, to make crimſon ſinnes as white as wooll, to purifie thy nature, to waſh filth and guilt from off thy ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Ther's an healing virtue. Many wells among us cure diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But this well of ſalvation cures both kinds of diſeaſes, <hi>Pſal. 103.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Ther's a cooling virtue. Water cooles thy body: This cooles thy ſpirit, allayes thy paſſions, takes away thy heat. God's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in their ſufferings are oft like to breake forth into paſſions; but if they ſeriouſly conſider the meekneſs of Chriſt, it will much coole and allay their ſpirits. A fountaine abates heat: waſh in this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and it will allay thy heat of paſſion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>When wee thirſt after Creatures, our thirſt is the more enraged: wee are never ſatisfied with broken Ciſternes, empty pleaſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the world. But ther's a fulneſs in Chriſt to ſatisfie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Doe wee deſire wiſdome? In him are treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge. Doe wee deſire riches? his riches are unſearchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. All our freſh ſpringes are in him. Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it. Hee hath fulneſs of righteouſneſs, holyneſs, mercy, ſalvation; Thou ſhalt have as much as thy veſſell can hold. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a meaſure hee will derive of his fulneſs to thee.</p>
                     <p>5ly, and laſtly. This fountaine is perpetually running. The virtue of many medicines laſt but for a moneth, a yeare, &amp;c: but the virtue of Chriſt's blood laſts to all eternity. This fountaine can never bee drawn dry: you can never empty this fountaine.</p>

This I ſpeak, not for wicked men to ſnatch at, to encourage them in their preſumption: but to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the children of God to come and waſh in this fountain, which is full enough, broad enough, never drawn dry. Come then, make ſpeed, waſh and bee cleane. The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt waſheth us from all ſins, of all ſorts and ſizes, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 7. But if wee walke in the light, as hee is in the light, wee have fellowſhip one with an other, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> It's uſuall with the wicked of the world to reproach and caſt into the teeth of the godly their former faylings. I remember (ſaith one) whatever hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth now, this man was a ſwearer, a drunkard, &amp;c. Let this rule bee our monitour where God forgiveth and forgetteth, wee muſt forgive and forget. 'Tis true peradventure a Saint now, was

And if thy eyes were open too, thou durſt not caſt into his teeth his former failings. The child of God ſaith, <hi>Ego non ſum Ego—Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> Ther's a reall change for the better, a worke of grace wrought on the ſoule. Take heed of ſcandalizing and ſcorning the generation of the righteous, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. And ſuch were ſome of you, but yee are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified; but yee are juſtifyd in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You then that are waſht in this fountaine, <hi>rejoyce and bee glad that your names are written in the book of life,</hi> that you have received a white ſtone, a new name, the hidden Mannah. Stand then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and praiſing God that hath done ſo graciouſly for you, that when many even the greateſt part of the world, are ſhut out, cannot find the Dore, are denyed the right key, and the fountaine is lockt and barr'd againſt them: yet it's opened wide to thee, thou art waſht and cleanſed in this fountaine: Not any goodneſs in thee; but free grace and mercy makes the difference. Whatever aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, calumnies, reproaches thou meeteſt withall in the world from ungodly men, bee of good comfort, all is waſht away by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The world caſts dirt on thee: Chriſt waſheth thee cleane. O then doe not deſponde, doe not droop as without hope by reaſon of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, ſufferings, evill entreaties in and from the world. Drinke of the waters of this fountaine, They are the <hi>Reſtorative</hi> to revive and refreſh thy ſpirit. Thou meeteſt with diſeaſes, corporall, ſpirituall, oh come to this fountaine.

                     <p>Thou ſeeſt by experience, that the Ciſternes of the creatures are dried up. Honours, Pleaſures, Profits decay and faile: tarry not at theſe ciſternes, goe to the fountaine, it's inexhauſted. Thy manifold ſinnes trouble and torment thee; ſinne is a havy burden upon the conſcience; thou art afraid to come. O! bee not afraid to do good unto thy own ſoule. This fountaine workes miracles, cleanſeth the Aethiopian and the Leopards ſpots, even a perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> a perjur'd <hi>Peter,</hi> an adulterous <hi>David,</hi> and it is not ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, unleſs thou ſhut out thy ſelſe.

                     <p n="3">3. In the work of Humiliation there's much delight, becauſe the ſoul hath much delight in looking back to that ſorrow it hath had: The wicked rejoyce in their pleaſures; the godly rejoyce in their tears. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> went ſad about the City, when the <hi>Thebanes</hi> were a revelling; when others have been in May-games and Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and laſcivious Enterludes, it will cheer up thy ſpirit that thou haſt been ſorrowing for thy ſin.</p>

But thirdly it's Objected, That godlineſs puts us upon hard ſervices, we ſhall meet with many ſcandals, great ſufferings and perſecutions for the name of Chriſt: we ſhall meet with ſore tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and tryals; Peradventure we may be brought to fry at a Stake for Chriſt: How then can the ways of godlineſs be ways of pleaſantneſs?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Notwithſtanding the hardeſt ſufferings that the heart of a godly man ſhall meet withal: yet there's that delight in the ways of godlineſs, as to uphold the heart under all ſufferings, and carry it on ſweetly: How much did the Martyrs rejoyce? They kiſt the Stake, welcomm'd Fire and Fagot; ſome of them leapt for joy, wrote ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Letters for the confirmation of their Brethren. Godlyneſs will carry thee chearfully through ſufferings: It will make thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thy Chains as Ornaments, thy Priſon thy Palace; thy Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon thy Paradiſe. Gods people ſuck ſweetneſs out of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hearbs: They finde an Honey-comb in the carcaſs of Lyons: They never ſee ſo much of God in proſperity as adverſity: Never do they feel more inward comforts, then amidſt outward ſorrows; for then God ſettles the tranquility of their ſpirits, and the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their conſciences. Chriſt appeared to <hi>Mary</hi> weeping; to <hi>Jacob</hi> at <hi>Bethel;</hi> to <hi>Elias</hi> after forty days faſting. God brings forth his Cordials to his people in their foreſt tryals; ſo that whatever ſorrows, hardſhips and troubles they meet withal abroad, yet they have joy at home; and though they may make many a hard meal: yet a good conſcience is to them a continual feaſt.</p>
                     <p>There's one Objection more which I ſhall anſwer, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Some object from common experience: When people come into the ways of godlineſs, they do not finde that delight
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116001:108"/> and joy as they had before: The world obſerves them to be more melancholy, and of a heavy dumpiſh ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>This is a meer calumny of the Devils raiſing to keep men off from the ways of God: This is a great pull-back and <hi>Remora</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many ſouls. I ſhall give a more full, and, I hope, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Anſwer to the Objection, in theſe following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>1. Religion denys not civil, courteous, and affable behaviour: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conſid.</hi> 1. Religion denys not civil beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> Religion forbids not a chearful diſpoſition: Nay, there's a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned to the contrary, <hi>Deut. 28. 47. Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs and with gladneſs of heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhalt thou ſerve thine enemies, ſaith the Lord.</hi> A churliſh <hi>Nabal</hi> is a diſhonor to Religion: Take heed therefore of diſcrediting the Goſpel by your ſad melancholy ſpirits, leſt the world bring an evil report upon the ways of godlineſs. None have ſuch chearful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as true Believers: Their heart is full and muſt have a vent; their tongues, countenances, carriages, will ſhew that they have comfort in God.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly conſider, thou maiſt miſtake Gods children: Thou <note place="margin">

The carriage of Gods children muſt be ſober and grave, their words ſerious, ſeaſon'd with ſalt, and their whole converſation muſt be ſuch as may adorn their profeſſion, <hi>Phil. 1. 27. Onely let your converſation be as becometh the Goſpell of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Conſider Gods people may appear ſad, becauſe they are out <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conſid.</hi> 3. Gods children are ſad when out of their element.</note> of their element. When the Fiſh is out of its element of Water, it cannot enjoy it ſelf. Birds do not ordinarily ſing upon the ground, but when they are got up into the Air. When Gods children are out of their courſe of duties, when they are in <hi>Meſeck, and have their habitation in the Tents of Kedar,</hi> their ſpirits are dumpiſh: But when their hearts are ſet in a right frame; when they are exerciſing holy Duties amongſt the ſociety of Saints, then are their hearts chearful, then are their ſpirits revived, then are they merry indeed.</p>
                     <p>4. Thou complaineſt of Gods peoples ſadneſs, maybe it's thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that makes them ſo. They hear thee Swear, ſee thee Drunk: O <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conſid.</hi> 4. Bad company cauſe Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſadneſs.</note> how this troubles them! It ſo troubles the children of God to ſee any diſhonor offered to God, as they cannot be merry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 136.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116001:109"/> 
                        <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy law:</hi> But let them come amongſt Believers, and joyn with them in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſes, their wonted joy comes to them again: Then their joy is above the joy of Harveſt, and the dividing of the ſpoil with the mighty.</p>
                     <p>5. It is not Religion that makes Gods children ſad; but becauſe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conſid.</hi> 5. Gods people are ſad becauſe they are no better.</note> they are no more religious: They grieve that they can grieve no more: They are ſorry that, they are no more ſorry for their ſinns: They finde many failings; they want former Love-tokens and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then they mourn and cry out, <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> They want Gods gracious countenance, wherefore they cry out, <hi>Pſal. 4. 6. There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. This Joy is ſecret, an inward thing, which ſtrangers ſhall not <note place="margin">

To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> The joy of the godly is not in outward flaſhes, nor is it to be meaſur'd by outward aſpect. This is a hidden thing, which ſo raviſheth their hearts as they cannot utter it. <hi>Saul</hi> could not be merry without a Muſitian; nor <hi>Ahab</hi> without <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; nor <hi>Gardiner</hi> that bloody Perſecutor, till he had receiv'd the news of the Martyrs death. A godly Mans <note place="margin">
                           <hi>v Fox</hi> Acts and Monum. in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Raign.</note> joy proceeds from no outward principle: A covetous man joys and takes pleaſure in his Barns heap'd with Corn, and Coffers cramm'd with Gold. A voluptuous man joys in Cards, Dice, Hauks, Hounds: A Drunkard in his Cups: An ambitious man in his Titles, Pedegree, Preferments: But a godly man can rejoyce and be merry without all theſe: His joy ariſeth from another principle, even the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled countenance of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Objections being remov'd, and my paſſage thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I come in the ſecond place to prove the truth of the Doctrine <note place="margin">2.

                     <p>I now come to the confirmation of the Point by ſome evident Demonſtrations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whatever pleaſure men finde in the world, is much more to <note place="margin">

For the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of it is better then the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then fine gold: She is more precious then rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her.</hi> Prov. 8. 14, 15. <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is mine, and ſound wiſdom; I am underſtanding, I have ſtrength. By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall inſtance in all the ſenſes: The eye takes delight in beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Objects. It's a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun: the Light is pleaſant, but no ſuch beauty as in the ways of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks much of the Ruby, and compares Wiſdom to it for its reſplendent Luſtre. Could the beauty of godlineſs be ſeen with theſe eyes, they would be dazled. <hi>Excellens ſenſibile corrumpit ſi ſenſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The eye of man hath ſeen ſtately Buildings, rich Treaſures, precious Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but the eye of Faith in a Believer ſeeth the holy Trinity, the Throne of God: In compariſon whereof, the braveſt ſights in the World are nothing, even leſs then nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The eare is delighted with melodious muſicke. Men love to heare a skillfull Muſitian. But in a tranſcendent manner the eares of the godly are delighted with hearing the word, the ſtrong cryes and prayers of God's people, the ſinging of Pſalmes, <hi>Pſal. 89. 15. Bleſſed is the people that know the joyfull ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Some antient Philoſophers phanſied
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116001:112"/> muſick in the Orbes and Intelligences to wheel them about. That opinion is much controverted amongſt themſelves: But this is an undoubted truth that there's no muſick ſo delightfull to the eare as duties of religion. They are pleaſant to God's eare. For hee loves to heare his people praying, and ſhould not they bee pleaſant to ours? And beſides, what wee heare of God now is but for a moment: what wee ſhall heare heareafter ſhall bee to eternity. When the damned are a roaring, skriking, howling, blaſpheming, curſing, weeping, and heare nothing elſe: Then the Saints ſhall heare Hallelujah's, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſinging, and joyne themſelves in a Celeſtiall Conſort.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The taſt ſhall bee delighted in the ways of godlineſſe. Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and drunkards delight much in their taſt. Curious taſts will not bee pleaſed but with ſweet and delightfull things. Now O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian get another taſt, a ſpirituall reliſh of heavenly thinges, <hi>Pſal. 34. 4.

                     </p>
                     <p>The third Demonſtration is, the wayes of godlineſſe muſt needs bee wayes of pleaſantneſs, becauſe they are all made up of Love. What comes from a principle of love hath much delight and pleaſure in it. Now every principle of the way of God is love. God ſets his heart upon us, and that love to us makes our love reciprocall to him. Love I may terme, <hi>Vehiculum animae,</hi> the chariot of the ſoule.

What wee love wee delight in. <hi>Pſ. 84. 1. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſtes: my ſoule longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>The 4th demonſtration is; The wayes of godlineſs muſt needs bee wayes of pleaſantneſs, becauſe they have the preſence of God; and <note place="margin">

Holineſs is God's Image<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God delights himſelfe in his own Image; and therefore hee lets out the influence of his love, and manifeſts his peculiar preſence to thoſe that walke in theſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:116001:113"/> wayes. Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and God tranſlated him. Thus the Apoſtles ſang in priſon. They had merry hearts, becauſe God was with them. Thus <hi>David</hi> at Ziglag <hi>encouraged himſelfe in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 6. God is in them, and lets out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto them: Now the quinteſſence of all good put together is in every beame of God's reconciled countenance, and therefore when God thus manifeſts himſelfe to a ſoul, there muſtneeds be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> perſons are ſons of peace, <hi>Luke 10. 6. And if the ſon of peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it; if not, it ſhall turn to you again. And if ſons, heirs, peace is their inheritance and legacy.</hi> John 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> John 16. 33. <hi>Theſe things I have ſpoken unto you, that you might have peace; in the world you ſhall have tribulation: But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. For their life: Notwithſtanding afflictions and perſecutions, troubles from the world; yet their whole life is peaceable. A God reconciled, a Conſcience pacified, makes them full of peace amidſt varieties of troubles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In their deaths: The remembrance of their uprightneſs of heart, and their utmoſt endeavor to ſerve God in ſincerity, brings abundance of peace, inward peace, a tranquility in their ſpirits, 2 <hi>Kings 20. 3. I beſeech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> Whatever ſtorms may be from the Fleſh, Divel and World; yet a ſerene, pacified conſcience, makes a great and quiet calm in the ſoul.</p>

                     <p>For firſt, Wiſdom onely can direct to peaceable pathes: Ways of wickedneſs lead us into Precipices and Dangers: Wiſdom ſhews the good and right way: This <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhewed the people, 1 <hi>Sam. 12. 23, 24. Moreover, as for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way. Onely fear the Lord, and ſerve him in truth with all your heart: for conſider how great things he hath done for you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Wiſdom protects its followers in the ways of peace: It ſhews them the good way, and protects and defends them in it, <hi>Prov. 4. 6, 7. Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhall preſerve thee; love her, and ſhe ſhall keep thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Wiſdom and Godlineſs remove all ſtumbling Blocks, Envy, Malice, Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Enemies to peace, <hi>Prov. 4. 12. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>4. Wiſdom ſatisfies the hearts of thoſe who are its followers: The ſpirits of the godly are quieted, and eſtabliſhed in thoſe ways; whereas ſtill there are troubles, and vexations, and diſquietneſs in ways of wickedneſs: But godlineſs pacifieth the conſcience, and quiets the ſpirits of Gods children.</p>

                     <p>I ſhewed formerly the cauſes of peace, wicked men want all theſe.

                     <p>For Inſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Be inſtructed in theſe particular Duties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Select the ways of godlineſs, and walk cloſe in them: Turn neither to the right hand nor to the left: Walk ſtraight forward, and ſquare all your actions by the rule, which is the Word of God. When men relinquiſh their callings, and walk out of Gods ways, then troubles and calamities befall them, and they can take no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them. But when thou walkeſt exactly, and keepeſt cloſe to God, whatever croſſes befall thee, thou maiſt take comfort: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace thou maiſt injoy in the midſt of outward troubles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Get a ſpiritual acquaintance with God, <hi>Job 22. 21. Acquaint thy ſelf with him, and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Job 34. 29. <hi>When he giveth quietneſs, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Get thy peace made in heaven.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Chooſe any affliction, rather then wound thy conſcience by the leaſt ſin, <hi>Job 36. 21. Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this haſt thou choſen rather then affliction.</hi> To procure peace with men, O do not hazzard thy peace with God, and the ſerenity of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: No peace like to the peace of a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Here's comfort to Gods people: Amidſt all their troubles they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy abundance of peace: The ſerenity of a good conſcience quiets their ſpirits, ſo that the fierceſt turbulent <hi>Euroclydons</hi> cannot ſhake them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. For anſwer I demand: Art thou weary of the burthen of thy ſins, and art thou ſenſible of thy inſupportable burthen? Art thou acquainted with thy miſerable condition, and apprehenſive of thy wretchedneſs?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Doſt thou willingly allow thy ſelf in no ſin, though never ſo ſecret, though ſin of delight or conſtitution?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Doſt thou deſire grace for to ſanctifie thee, as well as mercy to pardon thee?</p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou rather be rid of thy ſins, then the puniſhments due to them? Then thy condition is full of hope: And I ſhall propoſe theſe counſels to thee.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Remove all hinderances of thy peace, all murmuring diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented expreſſions: If peace comes not as ſoon as thou wouldſt have it; take heed of <hi>Rachels</hi> paſſionate language, <hi>Give me children, or elſe I die.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. Cheriſh thoſe motions of the ſpirit and feelings that Chriſt puts into thy heart: When Chriſt gives thee one good look, O make much of it! 'Tis mercy thou haſt one good look: O ſet a high prize of it! Chriſt ſometimes comes and dines, and ſups with his Spouſe, and then ſhe is overjoyed: other while he abſents himſelf from her, then ſhe's ſick for him.

'Tis true that every ſinne deſerves damnation, but all ſinnes doe not actually damne, otherwiſe who could be ſaved? There are two ſorts of ſinners, penitent, and impenitent ſinners.

The law requires exact obedience, will not abate a tittle, not the leaſt tranſgreſſion; God hath given us a Court of mercy, the Goſpel, and in it a ſurety, Chriſt, and the inſtrumentall meanes, faith, and repentance. Now, impenitent Perſons, deſpiſe the Goſpel, the ſuerty, the remedy, they reject the great ſalvation tendred in the Goſpel, and ſo they are left unexcuſable. Their bloud be upon their own heads.

Let me aske the voluptuous liver, what doe all his pleaſures conduce to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his ſoul? what comfort can a man take at night when he goeth to bed, when all the day he hath paſt away in gameing, drinking, and carrowſing? How many ſpend more upon their houndes, then they doe towards the maintainance of a faithful Miniſtry? How many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a pack of cards, a pack of houndes, a caſt of hawkes, before the word of God? How many preferre a drunken merry meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sermon? They can ſit whole days and nights at cards and dice, and at their cups upon ale-benches, and yet how weary at a Sermon? Double duties are tedious to them, ſabbaths, faſts, are heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens unto them. This ſin of voluptuouſneſs, is the crying ſin of the nation, for which God lets us bloud by his heavy judgments at this very time; O that all voluptuous Epicures would ſeriouſly lay to heart the ſacred Irony of the wiſe man! <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11 9. O! that God would perſwade you to have ſpecial regard of your pretious ſoules! O that God would open your eyes to ſee your vanities and wicked pleaſures, and turne the ſtreame into the right channel, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17.

                     <p>2. Let me expoſtulate the caſe with the covetous Mammoniſt; He riſeth early, &amp;c: hee's a ſcrapeing, and carking for the world, the traſh and pelfe here below, filling his barnes with corne, his cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers with gold, ſtill labouring for corne and oyle, never ſatisfied, never thinking he hath enough.</p>
                     <p>But what's all this to the ſoule? His Mammon is his God, the wedge of gold is his confidence. Hee's earth'd before his time, his heart is rivetted upon the world. Surely he dreames of an eternity upon earth, and of heaven upon earth: Hee heeds not, nor regards any hereafter. His breath ſmels of earth, his diſcourſe is earthly, his whole life and converſation is an earthly worldly converſation. But what will all his riches availe him when death arreſts him? See, <hi>Zeph. 1. 18. Luk.</hi> 12. 17, 18, 19, 20, and the 21. <hi>v,</hi> makes the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Thou canſt not carry thy riches to another world, they cannot bribe the flames of hell, nor corrupt the Tormentor; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſhouldſt thou labour thus greedily for that wich is not bread, for thoſe things which are not? wherefore ſhouldſt thou
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:116001:128"/> take ſuch care for traſh and pelfe, the baſe, tranſitory traſh of the of the world, which laſts but for a ſhort ſeaſon, and in the <hi>interim</hi> neglect thy pretious ſoule, which abides unto all eternity?

                     <p>3ly. Let me expoſtulate the caſe with the ambitious man, who aſpires unto great places, dignities, honours, and promotions in the world? What are all theſe in compariſon of his ſoule? Many have great Titles, honourable names in this world, who ſhall be degraded of all in the world to come. What's honour?

Above all trades which you drive for the world, learne this ſoule trade, this ſoule thriſt. I perſwade you to take the moſt thriving, moſt gainfull way in the world: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others labour for corne and oyle, wealth, dignities, which are failing periſhing things, which are not bread, and cannot ſatisfie, let me perſwade you to labour for that which endureth to eternity.

This courſe is wiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29. It's rich and honourable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. The godly are moſt honourable. It's thriving and gainfull, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6.

To quicken your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall recommend to your ſerious thoughts theſe 9 moving conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>1. One ſoule is more pretious then all the kingdomes of the <note place="margin">Conſid. 1. <hi>One ſoule is more worth than the world.</hi>
                        </note> world, and the glory of them; Seeſt thou a poor man picking off a dunghill old caſt rags, another picking ſticks or coles out of the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, almoſt ready to famiſh by reaſon of hunger, or to ſtarve for want of fire: ſeeſt thou others working for a penny a day, going many a mile to earn a penny, and ſcarce able to go through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; however theſe poore people may ſeem vile and contemptible
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:116001:129"/> in the eyes of the world, yet their ſoules are more worth, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to be valued, then all the pomp and bravery of the world: My Reaſons are,</p>
                     <p>1 Becauſe the world is tranſitory, fading, periſhing; the ſoule permanent, abiding to eternity. The forme of the world paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; this goodly ſtructure of this viſible globe, ſhall be diſſolved and burnt up with fire, but the ſoule is incorruptible, capable of no conſumption; now that which is permanent is of more worth then that which is tranſient, therefore the ſoule is more worth then the world.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all the riches, honours, bravery, &amp;c. in the world cannot redeem one ſoule; If a man would give all his lands, gold and ſilver, &amp;c. to ſave his ſoule, it could not be obtained: the Mannors, Lands, and richeſt treaſures of the whole world put altogether, cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one ſoule: the ſoule cannot be bought nor purchaſed by ſuch a price, when death arreſts a ſinner to appeare before the judgement ſeat, the ſinner would give ten thouſand pounds for a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nay all his eſtate, riches, &amp;c. but all theſe cannot bribe death to ſtay one minute longer, nor can they all make any atonement for the ſoule. Riches, honours, &amp;c. are not a ſuitable proportionable price, ſor theſe are materiall and corruptible, the ſoule immateriall and incorruptible, and between theſe there's no proportion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The price paid to redeem our ſoules is infinitely, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively more worth then millions of worlds, what's that, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. The ſoul was redeemed with the price of bloud, even of him who was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: not one ſoule ſaved any other way; not the richeſt in the world, nor the pooreſt can come any other way to heaven, but by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſoule of the pooreſt ſaint (though his perſon be trampled on by the world) is bought by ſo great a price, as the effuſion of the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence it evidently appeares, that the ſoul is more worth then the world, Chriſt died not for the world, he prayed not for them, <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. but he died for his own, whom his father had given him out of the world. O <note place="margin">Conſid. 2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt alone, and the graces of his ſpirit can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the ſoule.</hi>
                        </note> pretious, heavenly-born-being ſoule!</p>
                     <p>2ly. It's Jeſus Chriſt alone, &amp; the graces of his ſpirit that can beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, enrich, and adorne the ſoule. Aske a covetous Mammoniſt where lies his riches? he'll tell you in ſuch a ſtock of cattell, ſuch lands &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennues, gold &amp; ſilver, &amp;c. Aske a child of God where are his riches? he'll tell you his riches are in Chriſt, his treaſures are in heaven, his

They will ſhew you their neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces; and bracelets of pearles, their Diamond-Rings, Gorgeous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell. But what's all theſe to the ſoule? The ſoule is not beautified with golden chains, coſtly raiment, pretious jewels. Ile tell you of a chaine of pearls, which will adorne your ſoules, and enrich you more then all the pretious gemmes the Univerſe can afford, read <hi>2 Pet. 1. 5. Pſ 45. 13, 14. Ezek.</hi> 16. 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. Thou mayeſt be rich in the world, yet poor in grace, thou mayeſt have a beautifull face and a polluted ſoule; goodly, brave, ſtately apparrell, and a foule rotten conſcience; outward beauty, inward deformity; fair without, foule within. Now Chriſt his graces can alone make thy ſoule beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull; His graces are the beſt ornament, and therefore beſeech him to beautifie thy ſoule, and to adorne thee with faith, love, and the reſt of the Graces of his ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Conſider, God out of the riches of his free grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Conſid. 3 <hi>God puts a price into our hands to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for our ſouls.</hi>
                        </note> puts a price into your hands by the Goſpell diſpenſations, which he expects you ſhould improve for the beſt advantage of your ſoules. Force not the Lord to complaine, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 6. you have ſermon upon ſermon, Manna falls frequently round about your tents, will you not ſtir out of your doores to gather it? you have the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces frequently diſpenſed amongſt you, you have bread in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and bread in the evening, many occaſionall ſermons. All theſe helpes and meanes are afforded by God for the good of your ſoules: you have publick aſſemblies continued, your eyes behold your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, you enjoy Sabbaths, dayes of humiliation, dayes of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, wherein Gods keeps open market for the good of your ſoules, and its your duty to huſband them all for the eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your ſoules? The Spirit knocks at your hearts, by the ſermons you hear, by all the mercies you enjoy, to take care of your pretious ſoules. The ſalvation of your ſoules is the intention and end of all our preaching. It's the only deſigne we have upon you, to win you to Jeſus Chriſt: all the Ordinances are the food of your ſoules, to keep your ſoules in heart, the ſabbaths are the market of your ſouls, you have ſoule-fatting Ordinances. Oh take heed, leſt a leaneneſſe enter into your ſoules. The markets will not alwaies laſt, the ſhops will not alwayes be open, now come and buy wine, &amp;c. Improve the Sabbaths, Sermons, all your Goſpel-opportunities for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal benefit of your ſoules.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Conſider, This preſent time of life whilſt you are in this <note place="margin">Conſid. 4. <hi>This is the preſent time to regard our ſoules.</hi>
                        </note> world, is the only ſeaſon and opportunity offered to make proviſion for your pretious ſoules, ſee <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. This is the time to worke out your ſalvation in, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. The time of ſeeking God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. This is the time of working <hi>the worke of faith, the labour of love, and patience of hope, 2 Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. This is the time of making our peace and reconciliation with God.

Now thou muſt run, otherwiſe thou ſhalt never obtaine; now thou muſt fight the good fight of faith, otherwiſe thou ſhalt never obtain the end of thy faith, the ſalvation of thy ſoule. Now thou muſt wreſtle, otherwiſe thou wilt never obtein the bleſſing. Now thy peace muſt be made, whilſt thou art on this ſide hell, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will never be made hereafter. There's no time for purgation in another world, for perfecting thy faith and hope; this time of life is the ſeed time, and according as a man ſoweth, ſo ſhal he reape.

Doſt thou foregoe pleaſures, profits, father, mother, wife, children, the deareſt and neareſt relations, when they come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with or oppoſition to thy ſoule?

                     <p>The Fifth Uſe ſhall be for Direction. To handle this Uſe for your <note place="margin">Uſe 5. <hi>For Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        </note> greater advantage, I ſhall acquaint you with ſome Impediments, which muſt be removed, and then I ſhall preſcribe ſome Duties that muſt be performed. Theſe Impediments muſt be removed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Love of the world. This is the ſoules clog and hinderance, <note place="margin">Imped. 1. <hi>Love of the world.</hi>
                        </note> which keeps it from ſoaring aloft. The earth wormes of the world love their Mammon; their Gold is their confidence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 14. The young man in the Goſpel, <hi>Judas,</hi> the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> preferred the world before Chriſt. If you would regard your ſoules, you muſt ſit looſe off the world, your hearts muſt be alienated from the love of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Too much love of the body, ſuch pampering a carcaſe with <note place="margin">Imped. 2. <hi>Too much love of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
                        </note> variety of delicate meates, ſo much time ſpent <hi>inter pectinem &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> in trimming up the body, theſe hinder the care of the ſoule. The body muſt be loved in a ſubordinate way; ſhall we take more care of the carcaſe which muſt be wormes meat, and neglect the ſoule which runs parallel with eternity? The ſoule is <hi>animae manci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> will you preferre the ſervant, and the drudge before the Maſter?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Remiſſeneſſe in ſpirituall duties. Theſe are the ſpiritual viands, <note place="margin">Imped. 3. <hi>Remiſſeneſſe in ſpirituall duties.</hi>
                        </note> which keep the ſoule in heart. Take away theſe you ſtarve the ſoul: they are as neceſſary as meat and drink for the body. If you keep not time and touch with God in a conſtant, conſcientious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties, it's evident you have no care of your ſoules. The ſoule hath need of all duties, prayer, reading, hearing, meditation, conference, theſe are <hi>Pabula animae, &amp; animae vehicula:</hi> they wing the ſoule, and make it ſoar aloft. As you love your ſoules neglect not ſpiritual duties.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Preſumption of long life. Its a dangerous thing to preſume of <note place="margin">Imped. 4. <hi>Preſumption of long life.</hi>
                        </note> long life, when as neither ſpace nor grace is in our power. This is that ſoule-murtherer, that hath ſlaine many thouſands. Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of time, God cuts them off in the midſt of their ſins. Many have time, and preſume of grace; though God gives them ſpace, he denies them Grace, as he did to <hi>Jezabell, Rev.</hi> 2. 21. Its an exceeding great folly to preſume of that which is out of our power, its an high contempt and affront offered to God, to offer him the lame and the blind, to offer him (that I may ſpeak it with reverence) the Devils
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:116001:132"/> leavings; when the Devill hath ſucked out the marrow, to leave unto the Great God the empty dry bones.</p>
                     <p>5ly. Carnall ſecurity. See dreadfull judgments of carnally ſecure <note place="margin">Imped. 5. <hi>Carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. Labour as much as in thee lieth to keep thy ſoule unpolluted <note place="margin">Duty 1. <hi>Keep thy ſoul pure.</hi>

Do thou hate that which God hates; make no peace with Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, give not quarter to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> make no league with any <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> ſpare no <hi>Agag,</hi> foſter no <hi>Delilah,</hi> no <hi>Herodias,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Covenant in the ſtrength of God againſt thy corruptions. <note place="margin">Duty 2. <hi>Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.</hi>

I can do nothing without thee, but <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Set time apart every day for a ſerious ſearch and examination <note place="margin">Duty 3. <hi>Set times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for ſelfe ſearching.</hi>

                        </note> ſhall I neglect that which coſt Chriſt ſo dear? ſhall I diſregard that which extracted the pretious bloud of Chriſt out of his veines? Didſt thou frequently conſider the worth of thy ſoule, the ineſtimable price paid to purchaſe it, it would make thee look to thy ſoule.</p>
                     <p>5. Labour to get all thy ſoule-pollutions waſht away in the <note place="margin">Duty 5. <hi>Goe to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> Duty 6.</note> bloud of the covenant: go to the fountaine and waſh there.</p>

Whilſt others adorne and beautifie their bodies, i. e. the outward man, theſe labour to adorne the inner man, i. e. their immortall ſoules. Others labour to be rich and great in the world, theſe labour to be rich in grace, and great in the Favour of God. Others not knowing, nor underſtanding the worth of their ſoules, preferre earthly treaſures before them: but true Believers ſet a higher rate upon their ſoules, than all the Treaſures under the Sun. Oh happy people, that make it their buſineſſe to beautifie their ſouls with all the ſaving graces of the ſpirit! As they have ſown, ſo they ſhall reap. In this world they ſhall reap the firſt fruits, but in heaven the full harveſt. There they ſhall attaine unto the end of their faith and hope, even the ſalvation of their ſoules unto all eternity.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116001:142"/> all his Sufferings as juſt Puniſhments of his Hypocriſie: Many Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues there paſſed between <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, with ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and Replyes. At this time he hath to deal with <hi>Zophar</hi> the <hi>Naamathite; Zophar</hi> gives him good counſel indeed, <hi>To put ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity far away,</hi> Job 11. 13, 14. It's true in <hi>Theſi,</hi> but not in <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi:</hi> The Doctrine is good, the Application, as to this upright man <hi>Job,</hi> altogether impertinent; thereby he inſinuates, as if ſome Bribery was in the hands of <hi>Job,</hi> being an innocent Perſon, as to Men; and indeed chaſtened thus by God, not becauſe he was a greater Sinner then others, but for his tryal, the demonſtration of his Faith and Patience, and to make it appear to all the World, that the Devil was a Lyar; <hi>Job,</hi> I ſay, vindicates himſelf from his Friends aſperſions, and betakes himſelf, in the 12, 13, and 14 Chapters, to a plenary anſwer; his affliction makes him to ſpeak, <note place="margin">Job 12. 3, 4.</note> he's ſenſible how cheap an eſteem they had of him, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 3, 4. <hi>He was as one mocked of his neighbour:</hi> The remedies they apply to <note place="margin">Job 13, 4.</note> him, are worſe then his diſeaſe; he ſpeaks plainly to them, <hi>Job 13. 4. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all Phyſitians of no value:</hi> He's ſurrounded with miſeries, he's like a very <hi>Skeleton,</hi> all his Bones may be told; he lives a dying life. Mark his Queſtion, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 14. he gives in an excellent Anſwer and Reſolution, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. But that which renews his grief, is Gods hiding his face from him; if men fail him and deſpiſe him, he can eaſilier brook that; he ſtands upon his vindication, <hi>quoad hominem;</hi> but if God be angry, and account him an enemy, there's his grief, that's the wound indeed, <hi>v.</hi> 24. He further expoſtulates the matter, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Wilt thou break that which hath no power?

                        <hi>Daughter of ſin: An old man is ſucceſſor to himſelf a young man.</hi> There is, as it were, a natural ſucceſſion and derivation of ſins committed in youth, to become the inheritance of old age: So that a ſinner becomes his own Heir, the old ſinner the young mans Heir. The meaning is, A man that runs on in a riotous ungodly courſe, following his ſwinge and full career in wickedneſs in the days of his youth, ſhall feel the ſmart and bitterneſs of his ſins in his old craſie bones: We render the word in the Text ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>to poſſeſs,</hi> and that is Emphatical: A man that hath preſent poſſeſſion of his Inheritance, hath moſt points in the Law; The right next Heir hath a legal Title. Now when the Heir hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Inheritance, this adds to the ſtrengthning of his right. Now an old ſinner doth inherit and take poſſeſſion of his youthful ſins; and this is a ſad poſſeſſion, to poſſeſs the inheritance of ſin. It was charged upon <hi>Ahab,</hi> for <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>taking poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> there is the killing of the ſoul, when there is poſſeſſion took of ſin.

                     <p>I have one Query more to propound: How is it, ſince <hi>Job</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">

                     <p>2. Though ſins may be pardoned, yet the ſoul may not be able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to read that pardon, it may want the manifeſtation of the pardon; though there may be a pardon ſealed, an acquittance, a white ſtone in the Court of the Judge, yet it may not appear ſo in the Court of a mans own Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>3. We are to know, that Fatherly chaſtiſements are the lot and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>4. It is wiſdom in a godly man, when preſent ſufferings are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> him, to call former ſins to remembrance: Afflictions brings ſins to remembrance. <hi>Job</hi> lookt back upon his former failings, he was not unmindeful of his preſent failings, but his former, in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, might call for a rod of correction to whip out his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                     <p>Thus you have heard the Explication of the words, from which I'le draw one Point of Doctrine, which I take to be the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Doctrine of the Text:</p>

This ſpace God allows them for repentance, and they had <hi>Noah a Preacher of righteouſneſs,</hi> and they ſaw the Ark a building, and every ſtroke ſtrucken: The building of the Ark ſhould have been a Monitor of repentance; this was great and wonderful long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, as we read, 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20. <hi>By which he went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah.</hi>

                     <p>Now that this is ſo great a Judgement, for the Spirit of God to leave ſtriving with a people, may be exemplified in ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, recorded in Scripture as ſignal Spectacles of Divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Poſterity. The Lord ſpared <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> a long time: <hi>Abraham</hi> undertakes, <hi>though duſt and aſhes,</hi> to intercede for them. He intreats, <hi>That if fifty righteous perſons be found there, that they may not be deſtroyed:</hi> His requeſt is granted, he abates five of fifty, and then comes down to forty, after that to thirty, from thirty to twenty, and at laſt to ten; and it is to be obſerved, that God never left off granting, till <hi>Abraham</hi> left off begging: They had good <hi>Lot</hi> to reprove and exhort them, and <hi>they vexed his righteous ſoul day by day with their unclean converſation;</hi> he ſpent his ſpirits, his counſels, admonitions, all in vain: Now God will ſpare them no longer, the Angel delivered <hi>Lot</hi> from them, and as ſoon as ever he was gone, the Lord deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>Gen. 19. 24, 25. The Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he over-threw thoſe cities and all the plain, and all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</hi> The Lord waited a long time upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſending his Prophets,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116001:156"/> and warning them; he puts them in remembrance of his exemplary Judgements upon others, <hi>Jer. 7. 13.

                     <p>Some Reverend Divines have given three Signs of night.</p>
                     <p>1. When the ſhadows grow long, when wilde Beaſts go abroad, <note place="margin">1. When ſhadows grow long, it is a ſign of night.</note> and when Labourers go to their reſt. Now he's a meer ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who knows not how of late years Shadows, fruitleſs and ridiculous Ceremonies, have been advanced and ſtickled for, and violence hath been offered unto many tender conſciences: <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae:</hi> Many godly Miniſters, with their Families, have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116001:157"/> been ruin'd for non-conformity; and others have been forced to leave the Land of their Nativity, when as in the mean time the fundamentals of Religion, Faith, Repentance, Love, Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were neglected, and much diſcountenanced, and the zealous Preachers of theſe Doctrines, ſtigmatized with the odious nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names of <hi>Puritans,</hi> which in a proper ſenſe, is that proud Hereſie of <hi>Novatus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> records in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory: But <note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt.</note> through the iniquity of the time, was uſed as a brand of Infamy to reproach the moſt ſtrict and conſcientious Profeſſors.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Wilde Beaſts went abroad: Then thoſe of the Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <note place="margin">2. Wilde Beaſts go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</note> Prelacy perſecuted the old Puritans, under the name of non-Conformiſts: May ſuch perſons never range again, under more plauſible names and ſpecious pretences; or more covertly, like wolves but in ſheeps cloathing. I wiſh the Jeſuite may appear bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, that we may know him, and beware of him: It is a plain Jeſuitical deſign, to ſet Brethren together by the ears in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial matters, and ſo make them almoſt diſpute and jangle away their Religion. I wiſh what was blame-worthy amongſt ſome, be not Preached and practiced by others that ſucceed them; though names may differ, yet if the ſame thing remain, it's to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Melancton</hi> was deſirous to die for two reaſons: One was, <hi>That he might be with Chriſt:</hi> The other was, <hi>That he might be freed from thoſe bitter contentions that were in the Church in thoſe days.</hi>

Methuſelah,</hi> that godly longeſt liv'd Patriarch, dyed but the year before the Flood came: His name ſignifieth a Meſſenger of death: His death did preſage the Flood.

He might cleave us aſunder preſently, but there we have experience of ſingular patience: God was but ſix days in creating the world; yet (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves) he was ſeven days in encompaſſing the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> before he deſtroyed it: <note place="margin">Patientia laeſa fit furor.</note> but let us take heed of abuſing patience; <hi>patience abuſed, breaks forth into extremity of fury:</hi> Mercy pleads, I am ſlighted, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, I will no more have mercy on them; then patience inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, I will wait longer, but patience being abuſed, it pleads, I will be no longer tired out nor abuſed: At laſt comes long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am gentle and merciful, and I will wait longer and longer; but if long-ſuffering be wearied out, What will plead for us?

God ſends Judgements by way of revenge upon the wicked of the World, but by way of chaſtiſement unto his own children: When God takes away thy riches, and other outward comforts, as a childe, a wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by theſe the Spirit of God ſtrives with thee, and ſends thee to God to inquire into the cauſe, and walk more cloſely and humbly with God; and thy duty is, to pray to God to teach thee what thou underſtandeſt not: If God ſend thee a ſore diſeaſe, a grievous pain; ſuppoſe the Stone, Strangury, Collick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by all theſe the Spirit ſtrives with thee, and reads thee a Lecture of thy Mortality, and warneth thee to make a ſerious and ſpeedy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for death. Afflictions are ſent by God, as Scullions, to ſcour away the ruſt and canker of Gods children: They are the Shepheards Dogs, to bring home the ſtraying Sheep: <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>Afflictions teach us to underſtand Scripture:</hi> Where God teacheth with the rod, there he beſtoweth a choice bleſſing, <hi>Pſal. 94. 12.

The Holy Ghoſt ſets forth ſinful man in a full Character, Pſal. 14. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God, they are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.

                        <hi>were any that did underſtand and ſeek God: They are all gone aſide, they are become altogether filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Suppoſe we heard the Lord thus expoſtulating the caſe: Is this man? Is this he that I advanced to the higheſt rank of viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? whom I created after mine own Image, whom <hi>I</hi> endowed with noble faculties, an underſtanding, the bright luminary of the ſoul to know his Maker, and a will to obey him: Is he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fleſh, fleſhly in his imagination, fleſhly minded? Doth he walk after the fleſh, <hi>minding the things of the fleſh?</hi> Hath he thus turn'd Apoſtate, &amp; rebell'd againſt his Lord and Maker? This charge being all very true, wherefore ſhould I have any more to do with him? wherefore ſhould my Spirit ſtrive with vile ſinful fleſh? Thus God might plead, and in judgement withdraw the ſtrivings of his holy Spirit: Betwixt the ſpirit and the fleſh, what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can there be? The Spirit will not thus be unequally yoaked; ſince man is become thus fleſhly, thus depraved, ſuch a degenerate Plant, ſo corrupt, its juſt with Gods ſpirit to ſtrive no longer with man.</p>

Let me tell all ſuch that they are already dead, dead to God and goodneſs, they are dead in ſins, and follow Satan their chief commander, they dance after his pipe, go when he bids go, come when he bids come. But a day of judgement will come, then thou wilt be called to account for thoſe cups which thou haſt been mighty to poure down thy own throat, and for thoſe which thou haſt forced on thy brother: Then thou wilt be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for thy ſecret whoredomes, and abominations committed in the darke: Then thou wilt be called to an account for thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which thou haſt ſcoffed at, and gave no heed unto, for thoſe Sabboths which thou haſt profaned, and for all thy miſpent time, for all thoſe precious ſeaſons which thou haſt ſquandred away.

All thy books in thy ſtudy ſhall come and witneſs againſt thee, ſuch great helps thou hadſt, ſuch prices were put into thy hands, but they were prices put into the hands of a fool, for want of a heart to improve them.

At that day however wicked men have been flattered and idolized in this world, they will appear vile and abominable. The ſwearers are thoſe dogs, that are whipt out of the preſence of God.

When men profeſſe one thing, and practiſe another, pretending friendſhip with their mouthes, but meditating ruine and deſtruction in their hearts: When men make but Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtalking-horſe, for getting a prey, and as a cloak to cover wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed projects. When men have no regard to the All-ſeeing eye of God, ſo they can but eſcape the eye of men, what ſhall we ſay of them, but put them in mind of the words of the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccl. 11. 9. But know thou, that for all theſe things God wil bring thee to judgement.</hi> Then every vain thought, every idle word, every laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous glance, all mental reſervations, all hypocriticall colluſions, all time-ſerving complyances, ſelf-intereſts, ends, and aims, ſhall be all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116001:211"/> called to account, and laid open in the ſight of men and Angels.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Heres matter of comfort to the godly. At that day, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret deſires, breathings, longings, and pantings after God ſhall be <note place="margin">

The broken prayers, fighs, cries, inward compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of heart ſhall be all made manifeſt. The imputations, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, ignominies caſt upon the Saints ſhall then be wiped away. Many that have been condemned by men, ſhall be at that great day pronounced innocent. Holy Martyrs that laid down their lives for Chriſt, againſt whom the wicked of the world pronounced a ſentence of condemnation, ſhall at that day have a ſentence of abſolution pronounced by Jeſus Chriſt, and bee acquitted before that impartial Tribunal. It's a ground of great comfort to Gods children that God knows their hearts, how vehemently their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are towards him, as <hi>Pſalme 42. 1. Iſaiah</hi> 26. 9. Though the Saints cannot ofttimes expreſſe how their hearts ſtand affected, and are not able fully to diſcover themſelves, and open their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to man, yet God knoweth their inward groanings, their ſecret breathings, vehement deſires after Chriſt: Now all theſe are regarded by God; for there is not a tear, nor a deſire, nor a ſigh, which are not taken notice of by the great God of Heaven and Earth. The ſecret, cloſſet devotions, faſtings, prayings, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, which the world knows not of, nor underſtand the value of ſuch divine ſervices, all theſe ſhall be made known at the day of Judgement. Thou ſeeſt one chearfull, thou knoweſt not why: It's neither corne, nor wine, nor oyle, nor any thing of the world that revives his ſpirit. It's onely the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. that's the cauſe, hidden to thee, but a childe of God knows it. Thou ſeeſt another ſad and troubled, though he may have riches and honours in abundance, yet there is a ſecret damp upon his ſpirit, a ſecret cauſe of grief. It may be God hides his face from him; it may be thou art the cauſe of his grief; he ſeeth and heareth God diſhonoured by thee, and this is matter of mourning and ſadneſs to his ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Let then Gods children amidſt all ſorrows, comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the conſideration of a day of refreſhing, a day of reſtitution, a day of redemption and conſolation, which will one day be at the great and general Aſſize of the juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. I call it the perfection of happyneſſe. It's the aggregation of <note place="margin">1.

Many Stars make a Conſtellation, many waters make a ſea: All good things put together make up this happyneſs. There's no imperfection, no decay, no alteration: Eternal life takes in perfection of joy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of glory, perfection of degrees.</p>

Yet a little while and griſly death the <hi>King of terrours</hi> will ſeize on us; Here then muſt we be inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, what will become on our ſouls afterwards? We ſee God wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vanity on all ſublunary things, and they are full of vexation. The greateſt riches are uncertain, and periſhing; All the honours, and riches in their greateſt eſtate and confluence, cannot helpe a man in the evil day, nor ſatisfy an immortal ſoul, nor bring a man to eternity. Wherefore our great care and wiſdome ſhould be, to get an endureing ſubſtance, to get aſſurance of the love of God in Chriſt, and his love isan eternal love. We ſhould be exhorted in the language of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col. 3. 2, 3. Set your affections on things above, and not on things below. For ye are dead, &amp;c.</hi> Let me, in a few words (to preſs upon you the ſtudy of eternity,) adde theſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſiderations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. This ſtudy of eternity is an honourable ſtudy. It's a moſt ſublime, noble ſtudy, ſuitable to the ſoul. The underſtanding of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Conſid.</hi> This is an honourable ſtudy.</note> man is a noble faculty of the ſoul, and what more ſuitable for ſuch a noble faculty to contemplate, then the thoughts of eternity? God and Chriſt, and Glory, the bleſſed viſion, communion with the Father and the Son, theſe are objects fitteſt for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of an immortal ſoul. What a degenerate ſordid thing is it, for Princes children to converſe with baſe perſons? All Gods
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:116001:222"/> children are children of the great King of Heaven and Earth, and for ſuch to have their thoughts ſtuffed with traſh and pelfe of the world, O how unſuitable and unworthy is it! The <hi>Lapwing</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an embleme of infelicity; becauſe ſhe feeds on dung, though ſhe weares a Coronet upon her head. Shall then our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-born-being ſoules be proſtituted to <hi>Mammon?</hi> ſhall our thoughts be low and creeping? Our thoughts and negotiations ought to be on life and immortality, even the great things of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Our ſtudyes and meditations ſhould be on the things above, heavenly treaſures, <hi>an inheritance that's immortall, undefiled, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away.</hi> This is that noble, that honourable ſtudy, wherein we ought to be imployed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This ſtudy of Eternity is a moſt ſweet, delightſome, ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhing <note place="margin">2. <hi>Conſid.</hi> This ſtudy is ſweet and delightſome.</note> ſtudy. <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghill was comforted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a better life, and a glorious reſurrection, <hi>Job 19. 25, 26, 27. For I know that my redeemer liveth;</hi> and this comforted <hi>Stephen,</hi> when by the eye of faith he ſaw Chriſt, even when the <note place="margin">Acts 7. 55.</note> ſtones were about his eares: his temporall life was then a going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he was haſtening to a better. That life was tranſient, this permanent. Oh! how ſweet is the meditation of a God reconciled, of a crowne of glory, the price of our high calling. This makes the Saints deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt. The conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of heavenly conſolations, ſweeten the bittereſt pills of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For one moment in heaven will abundantly make amends for all our ſufferings and ſorrows on earth. This ſerious conſideration of Eternity will be a cordiall in all troubles: I have read that Q. <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anor</hi> ſuck'd the poyſon out of the wound of the King her-husband I am ſure the meditation of our everlaſting eſtate, will ſuck the poyſon out of thoſe wounds which affliction bring. Oh! how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull is the thought of a haven to ſuch as are toſt up and down with ſtormes and tempeſts: This world is a tempeſtuous ſea, rough and troubleſome, how delightfull is this meditation to a child of God, to think, I am paſſing through the rough ſea of the world to an eternall Harbour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is a moſt profitable ſtudy. We read of treaſures, crowns, <note place="margin">3. <hi>Conſid.</hi> This is a moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtudy.</note> high places, inheritances, layd up for the ſaints. In this world riches fail, in heaven is an induring ſubſtance. In this world ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours lie in the duſt, many are degraded, in Heaven no degradation. That honour is permanent, <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116001:222"/> that which is to come 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Wherefore then ſhould we carke and care and turmoile for the pelfe of this world, and in the mean time neglect eternal riches? What a doe? What a hurry? What ſollicitous turmoyling is here to get eſtates in this world? What projecting, torturing of mens braines, complying with men and times, to get honours and riches in this world? Whereas all theſe things are not bread, they are not the true treaſure nor abideing ſubſtance. But in the mean time how few are there that labour for ſpiritual riches, and lay up their treaſures in heaven. No treaſure like this, this onely inricheth the owners.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And laſtly, this is a ſeaſonable ſtudy. What are our lifes but <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conſid.</hi> 4. This is a moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtudy.</note> a blaſt? Our breaths ſoon depart, and then all our thoughts vaniſh, every affliction, every diſeaſe puts us in minde, that here is not our reſt, here we have not an abideing citty. Revolutions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; read Lectures to us of the changeable condition of the world. What then more proper and more ſeaſonable then to have our hearts took off theſe tranſient things, and fixed upon permanent things? There is no certainty here, but there is in another world. The world with all it's bravery paſſeth away: And there ſhall be a diſſolution of this frame viſible to our eyes. How nearly doth it concerne us, and how ſeaſonable a duty is it, to minde heavenly things, to fix our thoughts, meditations, <hi>totum hominem, totumque hominis,</hi> upon thoſe excellent things of eternity. Let's ſtudy this ſubject more then ever, and let us make more diligent inquiry after our eternal condition.</p>

                     <p>I have now diſpatcht my firſt head of Diſcourſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may ſerve as an Uſe of Tryal and Examination, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee offer unto God a Male, the beſt of our ſervices? doe wee offer all from the heart? doe wee lay hold upon the Lords ſeaſon? do we make Religion our buſineſſe? doe we in good earneſt ſet upon the ſervice of God? doe we all in faith, and in the name of Chriſt, with reverence and godly fear? If in truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity we can as in the preſence of God, give affirmative Anſwers unto theſe Interrogatories, then queſtionleſſe we offer unto God a Male; not that there's any worth or merit in our ſervices; for when we have done all we can, we are unprofitable ſervants; for there's neither <hi>dignitas operis, nec dignitas operantis, ſed dignatio Domini,</hi> when there is a willing mind, it is accepted. By Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> offered <hi>Iſaac;</hi> God knew the willingneſs and integrity of his heart, and it was all one in Gods eſteem, as if he had actually ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed him; for God accepted the Will for the Deed.</p>
                     <p>Now in the ſecond place, I muſt make good the proof of my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; and this I ſhall briefly doe, by giving in evident teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">2. The Doctrine proved. 1. From Scripture.</note> from the Scripture. For Scripture teſtimony, peruſe the whole <hi>Levitical</hi> Pedagogy: In all Sacrifices the beſt was conſecrated to God; particularly, a Lamb muſt be without blemiſh, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3. 7, 8. This was for a Peace-offering: For a Burnt-offering the Lamb muſt be of the firſt year, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 9. Why of the firſt year? but becauſe it was eſteemed the beſt; and it's there added, it muſt be without blemiſh: So likewiſe fine flower mingled with oyle, muſt be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a Treſpaſſe-offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 21. the beſt of the flowre, and the beſt of the oyle muſt be offered unto the Lord. In all offerings of Beaſts it's obſerved, that God gives a ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the inwards and legs ſhould be waſht, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 13. A young Bullock ought to be without blemiſh, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 3. A Ram ought to be without blemiſh, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 6. The Prieſts ought to waſh themſelves: What great purification was required before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Paſſeover? All theſe Types proves this Truth, that the beſt and pureſt ſervice ought to be offered up unto the Lord: <hi>Abel</hi> brought the firſtlings of the flock, and the fat thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. He brought God the firſt fruits of his encreaſe, and the beſt, and fatteſt of his flock; whereas <hi>Cain,</hi> like a niggard, cared not what he gave, as though any thing would ſerve the turn; wherefore <hi>Abel</hi> was accepted, and <hi>Cain</hi> rejected.

                     <p n="1">1. To all in general, Let me exhort you to give God your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtrength of your age, the morning of the day, your firſt thoughts in the morning, let them be conſecrated unto the Lord: And if the firſt fruits be holy, the whole lump will be ſanctified. <hi>Pub. Scipio</hi> firſt went into the Senate to pray before he went into the Capitol to conſult: Chriſt was at prayer a great while before day. <hi>Mark. 1. 35. David</hi> prevented the night watches. The Jewes divided the day into three parts, the firſt was for prayer, the ſecond for the ſtudy of the Law, the third for worke. I have read that King <hi>Alfred</hi> the founder of the ancienteſt Colledge in our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, divided the day into three parts, eight houres for prayer, ſtudy and writing, 8 houres for eating, drinking and ſleeping, and eight houres in the affaires of the eſtate. My Brethren let's all make it our buſineſs to ſerve the Lord with all our hearts. Lets in good earneſt with all the members of our bodies and faculties of our ſouls give up our ſelves to God: Let's offer all we are and have even a whole burnt offering unto the Lord. Let's give God the beſt of the beſt. Let's not ſleep away a morning Sermon, and be in our beds when we ought to be in the publicke Congregation: Cannot we riſe early enough for our ſecular intereſt, and ſhall we neglect in the mean time the eternal good of our immortal ſoules? The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, and the wiſe men came from the Eaſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſhal any be ſo lazy as not to ſtep over their threſholds to hear a Sermon? Will men looſe this Manna for want of gathering it? Men ought to labour more to be good then to bee great, and to be more careful to diſcharge their places of preferment, then ſollicitous to procure them; What ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riding, ſolliciting, undermining, what ſcandalizing, ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perfidious dealings are every where to be found? Theſe waies of unbrotherly dealings are very frequently practiced in theſe evil daies. Theſe things (my brethren) ought not ſo to be. I fear thoſe times and practiſes are revived now a daies againſt which the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> complains <hi>chap. 7. 3. That they hunt every man his brother with a net:</hi> Thence an exhortation is inferred <hi>v. 5. Truſt not in a friend, put not confidence in a guide.</hi> But here lies our duty to doe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116001:229"/> all we can to promote the honour of God, to lay out our ſelves, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and all to advance the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. We ſeek our ſelves every where, our own honour, eaſe, and Intereſt: How greedy are many to get more riches, how ſollicitous of increaſeing their ſubſtance? But how careleſs are men of doing their duties, and diſcharging the great truſt repoſed in them? Wherefore the other part of my Uſe ſhall in an eſpecial manner be directed to two ſorts of Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Magiſtrates and Miniſters.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let Magiſtrates doe their beſt in their capacity to promote <note place="margin">1. To Magiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</note> the glory of God. They have great advantages put into their hands, and let them remember that they bear not the ſword in vaine: A Magiſtrate in Gods cauſe ſhould be like <hi>Levi,</hi> who knew neither Father nor Mother, nor Brother nor Siſter. Of all others a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould be a man of zeale and courage, he ſhould bring the wheel upon the wicked: Be they honourable or worſhipful, he ſhould not ſpare them in their wickedneſs. Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Sabbath-breakers; theſe ſhould be puniſhed, and Blaſphemers who are as bad as the worſt: For their abomination is never the leſs, becauſe they have ſo many to plead for them. It's an old Moral Law, never yet repealed, <hi>that he that blaſphemeth the name of the Lord ſhould be put to death. Lev.</hi> 24. 16. What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good may Magiſtrates doe? How many prizes have they put into their hands to ſerve God in their places? Let none be afraid to be good: Let them have this Motto or Monitor in their ſerious thoughts; <hi>Thoſe that honour God, he will honour, but as for thoſe that deſpiſe him they ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Here's one word to Miniſters and ſo for the preſent I ſhall conclude. Muſt God have the beſt, then let Miniſters offer to God their prayers, ſtudies, beſt paines. <hi>Luther</hi> uſed to ſay that prayer <hi>Meditation and Tentation makes a Preacher,</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> uſed to ſay <hi>Bene oraſſe eſt bene ſtuduiſſe.</hi> Let all Miniſters pray much; let them firſt ſtudy their own hearts, and then ſtudy their ſermons, which they preach to their Auditors. The Preacher ſtudied acceptable words. A Miniſter muſt be an Interpreter one of a thouſand: Gods mouth to diſtinguiſh the pretious from the vile: He muſt have the tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon. I have often thought of <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution to <hi>Araunah that he would not offer to the Lord, that which ſhould coſt him nothing,</hi> Queſtionleſs, tranſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Extemporary effuſions, vain fancies, forced Allegories, Wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne

Their ſpirits are ſerious, and their language ſavory, and they preach ſolid, Orthodox and ſoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving Doctrines. I muſt admire and can neuer enough bleſs God for the ſame. The ſaying is no more common than true, <hi>that the hope of our Church is in our young men.</hi> I will make no compariſons, I wiſh from my heart that we were all better, that we would preach more ſolidly and more frequently. And ſor mine own part I am of opinion that thoſe who preach moſt frequently haveing a ſingle eye at Gods glory, theſe are the beſt and moſt profitable Preachers, and doe moſt good to poore ſoules.

This Doctrine reproves negligent, lazy perſons, who are ſo farre from giving God the beſt, as they think any thing will ſerve the turn; wherefore they will be at no pains in Gods ſervice, loth to riſe out of bed to hear a Sermon: <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes ſuch, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9, 10.

Now to let youth have their liberty, and runne their courſe, to let them chuſe whether they will come to Prayers or no, to Scholaſtical exerciſes or no; this liberty will be their bane; and how heavy an account have thoſe to make to God, who have power to reſtrain them, yet are of <hi>Gallio's</hi> careleſſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

I doe not here ſet a barre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the eldeſt, but invite them to repent, and bewaile their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent time: But this is to forewarne, and caution people not to delay repentance till old age; for 'tis doubtfull whether ever thou mayſt live to be old.

                     <p n="1">1. Whether we give God the beſt in the duties we perform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether wee give God the beſt in the exerciſes of graces?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whether wee give God the beſt in our life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>In all theſe things God requires a Male, and the beſt of that Male, in the beſt of the beſt duties, the beſt of the beſt graces, the beſt of the beſt converſation. Let's as in the preſence of God, deale plainly and impartially in this Examination.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then, do we give God the beſt in our duties? doe we give God our hearts, our affections, and wills? Do we doe all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as in the preſence of God, in obedience to God, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eye, and reſpect unto Gods glory? Such queſtions as theſe put home, will ſearch to the quick.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt others, I ſhall fix only upon theſe three inſtances, <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter non excluſive</hi> (For in all the beſt is to be given to God.) This Rule admits no exception.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether in hearing of Gods Word, we give God the beſt? <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether in hearing wee give God the beſt?</note> This is a very weighty duty: And we are often enjoyned to hear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 29. Faith cometh by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. It's a mark of Chriſts Sheep to hear his voice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27. But amongſt hearers, three ſorts in four miſcarry, according to Chriſts own computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116001:235"/> for there are ſtony, high-way, thorny hearers; the Word of God is loſt in all theſe: Onely the good hearer profits by the Word, and brings forth fruit with patience. Wherefore we are not only exhorted to the duty of Hearing, but to the right manner of performing this duty; <hi>Take heed therefore how ye hear,</hi> Luk. 8. 18. Now whether in our hearing we give God the beſt, we are to examine three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How we prepare our ſelves before hearing?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How we demean our ſelves in hearing?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How we behave our ſelves after hearing?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, before hearing there is required preparation, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 1. Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God. Publius Scipio</hi> firſt went unto the Capitol to pray, before he went to conſult amongſt the Senators. Before we come to a Sermon, our duty is to ſequeſter our ſelves from earthly entanglements. <hi>Abraham</hi> when he went up to the Mount to Sacrifice, he left his Aſſes at the foot of the hill: Before the Jews offered Sacrifice, they uſed many waſhings and purifyings, <hi>Exod. 19. 14. Mephiboſheth</hi> dreſſed his feet, when hee went to <hi>David.</hi> O how ſhould we waſh our hearts before we come into Gods preſence! Before we come into the place where the name of God is recorded, we ſhould conſider of that ſoveraignty, power, purity, and Majeſty of God: We ſhould get our hearts ſequeſtred from the world; our pride, paſſion, and all inordinate affections ſhould be mortified; we ſhould have our ſpirits meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; we ſhould approach with trembling, reverence, and awfull fear of the great and glorious preſence of God.</p>
                     <p>2. In hearing there are two things required; Atte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion of the ear, and Intention of the heart.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There muſt be a ſerious attention; we read <hi>Luke 4. 20. The eyes of all them that were in the ſynagogue were faſtned on him.</hi> When we go to duty, we ſhould conſider of the preſence of God and Angels, and ſhould behave our ſelves with all reverence in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies. The Preacher ſhould be ſerious, grave, reverend, and avoyd all affected phraſes, uncouth, unſcriptural ſpeeches: He ſhould <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words.</hi> And hearers ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves with all reverence: Laughing at one another, idle gazing, wanton glances, roving eys, O! how unfit and unſuitable are they, as at other times, ſo eſpecially in places of Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:116001:236"/>2. In hearing there is required intention of the heart: The heart muſt goe along with the eare; and what we hear, we muſt labour to let it ſink into our hearts, and there make its reſidence: The heart muſt be affected in hearing; the heart muſt act vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and be fully bent upon God. His Word is precious, and none ought to fall to the ground: Wherefore we muſt rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ponder, meditate, apply, and labour for retentive memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This caution is of great concernment, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Heb. 2. 1. VVe muſt remember that in hearing we deale for life and immortality; we negotiate for Eternity, and drive a trade for our immortall ſoules: ſo we muſt hear to day, as for ought we know, we may never live to have another opportunity: Wherefore the heart muſt be in good earneſt, with all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof ſet a worke; The Love, Joy, Hope, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, all muſt bee ſeriouſly fixt and intent upon what wee hear.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, how we muſt demeane our ſelves after hearing. To this purpoſe I ſhall mention onely two Duties, which if put in practiſe, it's without all queſtion, that wee give God the Male.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it's required that we meditate on what we have heard: <note place="margin">1. We muſt meditate in the Word.</note> For Meditation is the ſpiritual digeſtion of a Sermon. This <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> much practiſed. It fareth with a good Sermon for the Soul, as with a good meales meat for the Body: By digeſting what we receive, we thrive the better: Wherefore after we have heard a Sermon, we muſt call our ſelves to a ſtrict accompt, rubbe up our memories, and labour to make what we have heard our owne, that this food may turne into our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we may eat and make a good meale, and digeſt the food of our ſouls even to eat the roll (as the Prophet did) <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it's required, that wee yeeld ready obedience unto <note place="margin">2. Wee muſt yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Word.</note> the VVord of God: For not the Hearers, but the Doers of the Word ſhall be juſtified. The life of a Preacher is the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the life of a Sermon in Preaching and hearing, conſiſts in the particular Application: what wee heare, wee muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and practiſe in our lives. Thus we give God the Male in our hearing.</p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:116001:236"/>
                     <p>A Second Duty wherein we are to examine our ſelves in, is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether we give God the Male in our prayers.</note> whether we give God the Males in our prayers, and ſupplications? Prayer is a great part of our religion, a great part of worſhip, wherein God is gloryfied; wherefore I muſt take the beſt paines I can to examine this point; whether in our prayers, we give God the beſt? whether we offer a Male, and not a corrupt thing? For tryall whereof, Il'e lay down ſome diſtinguiſhing characters, to differrence the pretious from the vile.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prayer muſt be humble, ſo did <hi>Abraham</hi> pray, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. ſo <hi>David</hi> prayed in a moſt humble manner, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 19. ſo <hi>Jacob,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Prayer muſt be humble.</note> 
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9. There's required an humble reverentiall frame of ſpirit in our approaches and applications unto the throne of grace. Conſideration of Gods tranſcendent majeſty and greatneſſe, and the apprehenſion of our own vileneſſe ſhould cauſe us in an humble manner to make our addreſſes, and preferre our ſupplications unto the great God of Heaven and Earth. Conſider likewiſe thou art a Creature, duſt and aſhes, a worme, and no man, a ſinner, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, an enemy to God, by nature a child of wrath, This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould humble thee in the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prayer muſt be in faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22. No prayer but that of faith can be accepted: No ſervice but of a Beleever is any <note place="margin">2. Prayer muſt be in Faith.</note> whit available in the ſight of God: Its the prayer of a righteous man, which availeth much: And only beleevers are accounted righteous in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Prayer muſt bee fervent, <hi>James 5. 16. Qui timide rogat, docet negare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. All Prayer muſt be put up in the name of Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 6. <note place="margin">3. Prayer muſt be fervent. 4. All Prayer muſt be put up in the na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Chriſt. 5. Prayer muſt be with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. 6. Prayer muſt proceed from the ſpirit of Adoption.</note> No petition can be excepted unleſſe it be prefer'd in the name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Prayer muſt be with perſeverance 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. Will the Hypocrite (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> pray alwayes? will he alwayes call upon God?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Prayer muſt proceed from the Spirit of adoption <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. Many have a gift and are ſtrangers to the grace of prayer. Many uſe a form, and yet are unacquainted with the Spirit of prayer. Many uſe prayer as a duty, few as a meanes; Wherefore we muſt ſhaddow forth the ſpirit of prayer, by theſe propertyes.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:116001:237"/>1. There's a warming of the heart, the heart powreth out its ſelfe before the Lord: Hence comes grones, ſighes, ſupplications. The heart is ſeriouſly affected. Prayer is rather heart labour, then lip labour, and the heart breakes, and pants after God in prayer: So was <hi>Hannah</hi> affected, in powring out her heart, before the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a Child-like language; There is <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Gal. 4. 6.</note> There is much difference betweene the language of Children, and Slaves, Gods children learn his language, and they come as children unto a Father.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Their aime, ends, and deſignes are Gods honour and glory: <note place="margin">3.</note> Self-ends and intereſts, doe not ſet men on work to pray; the ſpring that moves, is love to God, his honour and glory and the end and aime they drive at, is the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>In the next place its inquired, How may we give God the <note place="margin">

There may be a voluntary Humility, and a naturall humble carriage, but the queſtion is, whether we have that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility which is of the ſame ſtamp with ſpiritual Poverty? whether ſelf be emptied, Chriſt advanced.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For Meekneſſe; there's in ſome a more natural inclination to Meekneſſe: But when we are provoked to wrath, do we then ſhew meek ſpirits to bear and forbear with others? to overcome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with good, to heap coales of fire upon enemies heads?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For Temperance; where is our ſober, temperate carriage, in Abſtinence and Moderation? <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For Wiſdome; doe wee labour for Wiſdome, Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and honour God with it? lay forth our parts, intereſts, and all to honour God withall? <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth Uſe in order is for Direction: For the better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting home this Uſe as may be moſt profitable for you, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to anſwer two Queries.</p>
                     <p>The firſt whereof is; what impediments and obſtacles we ſhould remove that hinder us from giving God the beſt?</p>
                     <p>Then ſecondly; What ſpecial duties are required to ſhew the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Q.</hi> 1. What Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments are to bee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Imped.</hi> 1. Ignorance.</note> ſincerity of our hearts, that we offer God the Male, even the beſt of all our ſervices?</p>
                     <p>For anſwer unto the firſt Queſtion; the Impediments are theſe eſpecially.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An ignorant, blind mind; when people underſtand not the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, they will brayd of the Gadereniſh humour, they preferre their ſwine before him. There's ignorance ſufficient, when they askt, <hi>what is thy Beloved more than another beloved?</hi> Cant. 5. 9, 10. But the Spouſe gives an experimental an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. A frothy and vaine ſpirit: How many entertain a low and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Imped.</hi> 2. A frothy vain ſpirit.</note> cheap opinion of Religion, and think any thing will ſerve, as if any thing were good enough for God? Such a ſlight ſervice was done by <hi>Gehazi,</hi> he went on before, and layd his ſtaffe upon the child, and there was no appearance of life in the child; but the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> layd his hand on the childs hand, his mouth on the childs mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in good earneſt ſet upon the work, and the ſpirit of the child revived. It's the obſervation of a Reverend <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jerem. Burroughs.</hi>
                        </note> and precious Divine, that <hi>of all ſpirits, hee deſired to be delivered from a frothy ſpirit:</hi> it's therefore a matter of lamentation, and ought in good earneſt to be bewailed, to conſider with what irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116001:238"/> formalities, and ſlightneſſe of the ſpirit many ſet upon duty; ſome will pray partly between ſleeping and waking, ſo drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, that they can ſcarce pronounce their words aright; Others will mumble over a few words of courſe in their beds. Neither of theſe think of that reverence that belongs to the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and that he requires the Male, the beſt we can offer unto him.</p>
                     <p>A third Impediment is a worldly ſpirit: A heart ſwallowed up <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Imped.</hi> 3. A wordly ſpirit.</note> with the love of the world will never give God the beſt; ſuch ſpirits wil grudge any thing for God, becauſe the world hath ſeized on their ſpirits, and took up their affections: Their breath, words, converſations, even all favours of the world. Now this love of the world is the root of all evill, and enmity againſt God: <hi>Demas</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Apoſtles ſociety: The young man preferred earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures before heavenly; where the world ſits cloſe, and the heart is enamoured with the love of the world, there Chriſts riches and his excellencies are undervalued.</p>
                     <p>A fourth Impediment is an unbeleeving heart. Chriſt is not a <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Imped.</hi> 4. An unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart.</note> whit regarded amongſt unbeleevers; onely beleevers account him precious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. He that knew the worth of the pearl of price, and beleeved there was ſuch vertue in it, ſold all to purchaſe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46, 47.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Impediments being removed, ſome ſpeciall duties ought to be practiſed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Alwaies ſet before thine eyes the great God of heaven and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dut.</hi> 1. Set God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes.</note> earth, as omnipreſent, pure, and omnipotent, who ſeeth, knoweth, and ſearcheth all hearts. This conſideration will make thee afraid to preſent any thing vile and refuſe unto ſo great, ſo holy a Lord God. How thou prayeſt in thy cloſet, what thy ſecret, reſerved thoughts are, what thy intentions are in any duty, all are naked unto that great and glorious Majeſty with whom thou haſt to deale.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Labour for ſincerity of heart. That's it which will carry thee <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dut.</hi> 2. Labour for ſincerity of heart.</note> through all brakes, bryars, difficulties, and perplexities whatſoever. It's ſaid, <hi>Aſa's</hi> heart was upright, there's a nevertheleſſe put in, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 15. 17. It's this which comforted <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death was paſt againſt him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 3. It's that which God requires, <hi>even truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſ. 51. 6. It's that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116001:239"/> which is the cauſe of rejoycing, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. Nathaniels</hi> character, to be <hi>an Iſraelite indeed without guile:</hi> Joh. 1. 47. The upright are they which love Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. And they are Gods delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 20. Their Tabernacle ſhall flouriſh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 11. Their high way is to depart from evill, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 17. They walk ſurely, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 9. and no good thing will God withhold from them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84. 11. Their end is peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37. Upright walking with God will carry a man through all troubles whatſoever, and in life and death will yeeld matter of abundance of conſolation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Embrace the preſent ſeaſon of Grace; <hi>Seek ye the Lord whilſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dut.</hi> 3. Embrace the preſent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                        <hi>he may be found, call ye upon him whilſt he is near, Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. Now give God your ſtrength and marrow, and lay aſide all delayes, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and Procraſtinations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Be much in Prayer and Supplication, that what ever thou <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dut.</hi> 4. Be much in Prayer.</note> doſt, what duty, whatſoever ſervice thou offereſt unto God, that he would accept thee through Jeſus Chriſt. As the Ancients held the Plough and prayed, ſo hear and meditate on Gods Word, keep the Lords Sabboth holy, and pray for a bleſſing upon all from heaven: <hi>Bleſſe Lord his ſubſtance,</hi> Deut. 33. 11.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Make Religion thy work, the grand deſign thou driveſt: Let <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dut.</hi> 5. Make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy work.</note> thy generall calling as a Chriſtian have the preheminence of thy particular calling in the world; <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdome of God,</hi> Mat. 6. 33.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Uſe is for Conſolation unto thoſe who to the utmoſt in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. For Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſincerity of heart endeavour to walk before the Lord. Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, <hi>Gen. 5. 24. Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> walked in Gods Commandments blameleſs, <hi>Luk. 1. 6. David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart: Yet the beſt of Gods children have their failings, <hi>Jacob</hi> confeſt himſelf not worthy of the leaſt of Gods mercyes, <hi>&amp;c. David</hi> confeſt himſelf as fooliſh as a bruit Beaſt, and wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he had not the underſtanding of a man. It's a great cauſe of greif, and a burthen to the ſpirits of Gods deareſt children, to conſider how much they faile in duties: Their dulneſſe, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſorder of ſpirit much afflicteth them. What I ſhall further adde ſhall be compriſed in theſe enſuing conſiderations. <note place="margin">

                     <p n="1">1. Infirmities are incident unto the beſt of Chriſtians; <hi>I ſleep</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>Paul</hi> complains of a body of ſin, and of fleſh, and of an antipathy between fleſh and ſpirit.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Where the heart is ſincere, it is accepted; a willing mind is accepted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Where the heart is ſincere, it is not contented with what it hath already attained, but labours for more grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider, that others examples and attainments are not that ſtandard, for every one to meaſure himſelf by: No examples but that of Jeſus Chriſt is every way authentique. Some will ſay on one hand, Such and ſuch goe no further, and will not this ſerve my turne? others ſay, ſuch goe ſo farre, and if I cannot come near them, <hi>I</hi> may juſtly ſuſpect my ſelf to be an Hypocrite. Neither this nor that muſt determine us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And laſtly conſider, that Perſeverance ſhall obtain the Crown, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 15. Many beginne well, and fly back. Of all, Apoſtates are moſt hated by God: But as for ſuch who perſevere in Grace, and walk in ſincerity before the Lord, theſe ſhall be happy unto all Eternity; theſe having been faithfull unto the death, ſhall receive a Crowne of Life. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

                     <hi>HERE preſent unto thee (Chriſtian Reader)</hi> A third Decad of Sermons, <hi>of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion with the reſt, anſwering thoſe two imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly preceding,</hi> as face in water anſwers face. <hi>By them the Author may be knowne to be one and the ſame man, not varying a whit from his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by reaſon of viciſſitude of times. The firſt of theſe Sermons was preacht</hi> at the Publick Act, <hi>and was formerly printed which (notwithſtanding the deriſion of ſome) through the Incouragement and approbation of others (whoſe Judgment I preferre many degrees before my owne) is now againe preſented to publick View</hi> in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition. <hi>None of the other ſermons of this Decad, and none of the two other</hi> Decads <hi>were ever yet printed before: neither had now, if ſome both Godly and Learned (who are better able to judge) had not thought farre better of them, then I ever durſt of any thing of my own notwithſtanding what paines ſoever it coſt me. It's farre from my Intention to juſtify my ſelfe, but I ſhall alwaies with Jacob acknowledge my ſelfe,</hi> not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercyes, and of all the <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> truth<hi rend="sup">c</hi> 
                     <hi>which the Lord through riches of mercy hath ſhewed unto me. It cannot be denyed, but ought to be acknowledged with renewed thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that now adaies we have more helps on all hands, if we had our eyes in our Heads, and greater advantages then our Predeceſſors ever enjoyed ſince Printing came up: And ſince the Goſpell in it's Purity and Liberty was reſtored unto England (as Reverend</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>uſed to pray that God would</hi> reſtore the Goſpell <hi>unto England</hi> once againe, once againe) <hi>We have variety of Prices both by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preaching, put into our hands to get divine wiſdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Oh! that we had this great mercy of mercyes vouchſafed to us, that the Lord would beſtow upon us ſuch good hearts as to Husband, and improove all thoſe ſpirituall Talents for the beſt advantage of our immortall ſoules. That ſaying of a Learned Author hath often come into my deliberate thoughts</hi>—Ideo ſcribuntur omnes Libri, ut unus emendetur conſcientiae. <hi>Now if by any thing that I have wrote, the</hi>

                     <hi>of Chriſtians may thrive the better, and be built up in their faith, I have my deſire accompliſht. Not unto me, not to the beſt of my paines and endeavours, but unto the name of Jeſus Chriſt be all the praiſe and glory. It's not my purpoſe to detaine thee (Reader) in a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Epiſtle. Only thus much I thought good to premiſe, to aſſure thee that this</hi> laſt Decad is <hi>of the ſame ſtamp, and breaths forth the ſame ſpirit, and purſues the ſame plaine ſtile with thoſe two which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to order went before; The deſigne I only drive at (as farre as I apprehend) is the eternall good of mine and thine immortall ſoule; ſo that our profitting may appeare unto all, that ſome addition may be made unto our ſpirituall ſtature. Be pleaſed therefore to read de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, and to joyne prayer and meditation with reading. Lay aſide all prejudicate opinions, and through the meanneſſe of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, look with the eye of faith unto Jeſus Chriſt the great Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Prophet, who directs and inſtructs his people, and guides them unto all truth: And what ever good thou receiveſt, give Chriſt the praiſe of all, and ſet the Crowne upon his head alone. And in thy ſerious addreſſeſſe unto the throne of grace, remember him which in love to thy ſoule hath made theſe ſermons publick. Do not deſpiſe</hi> the day of ſmall things, <hi>undervalue not the Reare of the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Do not entertaine a ſlight opinion of any of the meaneſt, (yet faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) Labourers in Gods Vine-yard, who deſires and endeavours to approove himſelfe faithfull; ſuch a one I deſire to be, and remaine</hi>

                     <p>Now my text is the Uſe and Application of this Doctrine of Reconciliation. This 20. Verſe is an illative concluſion drawn from the premiſes delivered in the 19. verſe. In the former there's ſet forth the Reconciliation on Gods part: He though <hi>pars laeſa</hi> the party injured, contrives and deſignes this great work of Reconciliation. In the latter is ſet forth the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation on our part. We who are the Offenders and Rebels againſt God, are invited and intreated by <hi>the Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Ambaſſadors of Jeſus Christ,</hi> we would not try conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with God but forth with lay down our Rebellious weapons, &amp; embrace the word of Reconciliation. Although the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion long ſince is perfectly made on Gods part, &amp; Chriſt is a perfect Reconciler, &amp; thorough-working Interceſſor, yet there is required a ſpirit of Application on our part. This then is the grand

                        <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Biſhops of Alexandria, who when they were put into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fell at variance amongſt themſelves about a petty difference, whether the <hi>Lapſi</hi> were to be received into communion? The Schiſme was very great, inſomuch as they drew a partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each other in Priſon, and would not hold communion with each other, and yet afterward they joyntly ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. And it's not eaſily to be imagined, what a great Rent their diſſention made in the Church of God, and gave advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the common Enemy.

                     <p>And now to ſpeak my judgment more plainly as in the preſence of God, without partiality, having no mans perſon in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for advantage, I conceive it a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, and that there is neceſſity of ſpeaking of it, even to exhort Miniſters to ſtudy the things that make for peace, and eſpecially to agree in a ſweet Harmony one with another.

With what joy, with what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of love ſhould you embrace ſuch gracious offers? O how ſweet is the voyce of Chriſt unto his Church! His lips drop as an honey combe.

O how ſweet then will Chriſts words be to a gracious heart!

Of all people even enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are moſt afraid of a praying people: They meet with them at a diſtance and wound them, and ſtrike inviſibly and give them deadly blowes, not knowing who hurts them.

The Church of God meets with various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations ſutable to that prophecy, <hi>Zech:</hi> 6. 6, 7. Where were <hi>white, black, griſled, and bay horſes:</hi> And for the moſt part Gods deareſt Children drink deepeſt of the cup of afflictions, and have a full cup of the waters of <hi>Marah</hi> wrung out to them.

However it ſhall go well with the righteous, it ſhall go well with them that feare the Lord. God hath founded <hi>Zion,</hi> the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it: Chriſt is ever preſent with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116001:284"/> them, and though the Dragon caſt out flouds againſt the woman yet ſhe ſhall eſcape. And though there are <hi>Hornes</hi> to puſh the Church, yet God ſends <hi>Carpenters</hi> to cut them off. In the mean <note place="margin">Zech. 1. 21.</note> time how ſhould we unite and pray for <hi>Zion,</hi> that it may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and eſtabliſhed in glory. This meanes of prayer God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, God bleſſeth and maketh ſucceſſefull. <hi>Gebal, Ammon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleck,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> all the enemies that Hell can raiſe, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The ſeed of the Serpent is at continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enmity, even deadly feud with the ſeed of the woman. We read of their conſultation, <hi>Pſal. 83. 3, 4. They have taken crafty counſell againſt thy people, and conſulted againſt thy hidden ones. They have ſaid, come, let us cut them off from being a Nation, that the name of Iſrael may be no more in remembrance.</hi> We read of their aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Iſaiah 8. 10. Aſſociate your ſelves, O yee people, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces, gird your ſelves and ye ſhall be broken in pieces. Take counſell together and it ſhall come to naught: ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand: For God is with us.</hi> Of what neceſſity then are aſſiduous prayers, and importunate Applications unto God in the behalfe of <hi>Zion.</hi>

                     <p>And 5. and laſtly conclude with particular Application.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By fleſh we are to underſtand the corruption of the whole <note place="margin">

                     <p n="1">1. The nature of Man.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. And corruption of both.</p>
                     <p>Now this diſtinction muſt be without ſeperation of nature from faculties, or of corruption from either, ſo as we may ſay truly, that the nature and powers of the ſoule are corrupted. Now this corruption conſiſts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the depravation of Gods image, man was created after Gods image, but by reaſon of ſin he hath defaced the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a proneneſſe to all wickedneſſe, ſo that the nature of man <hi>is evill continually,</hi> and the ſeeds of all rebellion are ſowne in the corrupt nature of mankind, wherefore the Lord threatens <hi>That</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. In the next place we are to inquire, what's meant by affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Q 2. Whats meant by Affections and luſts.</note> and luſt's.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> By affections we are to underſtand inordinate affections, which beare ſway in carnall men, their affections are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, irregular, immoderate, and they are ſet upon the wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they love where they ſhould hate, and hate where they ſhould love.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116001:291"/> immoderate and inordinate in <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he could not get <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, <hi>he was heavy, and diſpleaſed,</hi> 1 King. 21. 4. Love was an inordinate affection in the men of the laſt times: <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleaſures, more then lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Luſts we are to underſtand, inordinate and inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the things of the world, as Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, of this ſort of inordinate affections are coveteouſneſſe, pride, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place, whats meant by crucifying the fleſh, with <note place="margin">Q. 3. Whats meant by crucifying the fleſh &amp;c.</note> its affections and luſts?</p>
                     <p>

                     <p n="1">1. Lets conſider Crucifixion as the action of Chriſt, and this <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion as the Action of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </note> conſiſts in three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Upon the Croſſe, Chriſt ſtood in our Roome, and bared the burthen of our ſinnes, and made an expiation for them: in this reſpect we are ſaid to be crucified with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond is in us, when Chriſt conveyes the vertue of his death in us, to cauſe the death of ſinne: when Chriſt gives us his ſpirit to mortify the deeds of the body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third is in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> whereby Chriſt ſealed the two former to them that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Lets conſider crucifixon as the Action of a Chriſtian, and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion as the Action of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                        </note> this conſiſts in the imitation of Chriſt crucified, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Chriſt was attached, apprehended, and brought into the preſence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſo muſt we bring our ſelves into the preſence of God, Chriſt was arraigned at the Tribunall of <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſo muſt we arraigne our ſelves at the barre of Chriſts judgment ſeate: Chriſt was indited and accuſed, ſo muſt we indite and accuſe our ſelves: Chriſt was condemned, ſo muſt we condemne and judge our ſelves, after ſentence paſt there followed execution, Chriſt was crucified: ſo muſt we proceed to the execution of our ſinnes, and corruptions. We muſt labour to be the death of every ſinne, to give every luſt a mortifying blow: we muſt not ſpare any Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſinne, that was <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne in ſparing <hi>Agag:</hi> but we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all, both great and ſmall: we muſt not only mourne for ſin, but hate it: not only hate it, but endeavour the deſtruction of it.

The beſt of Gods ſervants have unbeliefe in them, but they complaine againſt it. <hi>Bradford</hi> a rare mortified man complained much of his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, ſo we muſt complaine of our Infidelity, we muſt ſearch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, make hue and cry after our unbeliefe, and labour to finde it out, and having found it, arraigne, condemne, and crucify it. Two Motives I ſhall urge.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I'le draw ſome from the benefit of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the miſchiefe of unbeliefe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Lets conſider the benefit of Faith. Firſt, It gives title and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt <note place="margin">Motive 1.

                     <p>Secondly, Faith is a hand to lay hold on Chriſt: But not a working hand, as that hand of a labourer that earnes his living, upon his deſert and for his work receives his wages: But faith is a receiving hand of a poore man that layes hold on a pearle and receives all of mercy and favour from God: Hence faith is expreſt by receiving, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Faith gives inſight into heaven, and communion with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, From Juſtification by faith flowes all our comforts, and priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if the Conſideration of the benefit of Faith take no <note place="margin">Motive 2. From the miſchiefe of unbeliefe.</note> place, on the contrary take notice of the miſchiefe of Inſidelity. You heard before the reaſons of the Doctrine (after another ſort)
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116001:318"/> how Infidelity bound Gods hands, refuſed the remedy, I will adde other great miſchiefes, which ſpring from the fountaine of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, viz. theſe following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Unbeliefe makes all our prayers unavailable: To pray and not in faith is ſinne, for whatever is not of faith is ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unbeliefe cauſeth diffidence of, and ſtaggering at promiſes <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hinders and deprives men of Communion with believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Every thing is uncleane, and deſiled to unbelivers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. Their ſpirituall uncleanneſſe makes every thing uncleane unto them. The diſtinction of cleane and uncleane meates is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by the Goſpell, the uſe of them is pure to them who are cleanſed by Chriſts blood, and ſanctified by his ſpirit; but of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers it is ſaid <hi>Their mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Unbelievers are given up to damnable deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. That they all might be damned who believed not the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth Uſe is for Examination, and Triall of Faith, and <note place="margin">

                     <p>Fiftly, Faith is that whereby the juſt lives, <hi>Hab. 2. 4. Gal.</hi> 2. 20. A believer in a ſtorme gets himſelfe upon a Rock, he hides himſelfe in the clefts of a Rock, Chriſt is <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever climbes up thither, and there reſts: In dangers he goeth to God, hee's his Refuge, ſtrong Tower, and Bulwark of defence; In doubts God is his Counſellour, in diſtreſſe God is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
                     <p>Now lets inquire after ſome ſignes and ſymptomes of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer.</p>
                     <p>The firſt (which is to be reckoned in the fore front) is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall <note place="margin">Signe 1.

                     <p>The ſecond ſigne of Unbeliefe is murmuring, and impatience: <note place="margin">Signe 2.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Unbeliefe appeares evidently by that refuge which <note place="margin">Signe 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, They have Intereſt in all the promiſes, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. For all the Promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They have Intereſt in ſpeciall providences diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies, viz.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is theirs, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 20, 21. Rom. 8. 32. And with Chriſt they have all things.</hi>

                     <p>Fifthly, They ſhall injoy the preſence of God and be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the bleſſed viſion, <hi>Mat. 5. 8. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 2. Here they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God in his Ordinances, they have Communion with him, and feele ſpirituall Illapſes upon their ſoules, but this Ebbes, and flowes, they have many Interruptions and Intermiſſions but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſhall injoy an uninterrupted Communion with God to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, there are many doubts and ſcruples raiſed, for there are three ſorts of perſons who make objections viz.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. I begin with Unbelievers, and theſe are to be conſidered, under a double capacity, Either ſuch as are <hi>Heathens,</hi> to whom the Goſpell hath not been preached, in whoſe land the voice of the Turtle hath not been heard, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> no publick preaching of the Goſpell: or elſe ſuch as live under the ſound of the Goſpell, who have heard of Chriſt and his Goſpell preached, and yet they remaine in a ſtate of unbeliefe.</p>

See what their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17, 18, 19. And ſee their doome, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. Ignorance excuſeth not, nor exempeth from Judgment, though Ignorance may ſometimes extenuate and make a ſinne leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, yet it is a damnable ſinne: For a ſinne of Ignorance there was an offering to be offered unto God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 27.

Shall not the Judge of all the world do right?</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond ſort of Believers who live under the meanes, it's commonly objected: It is not in our own power we <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>2</label> cannot believe, God commands things impoſſible for us to doe.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. It's no injuſtice in God to command things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:116001:320"/> to fleſh and blood to performe, and that I will evince by theſe Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is not bound to give and keep a ſtock both, he gave us power and liberty of will in <hi>Adam,</hi> we loſt it and therefore its our duty to be made ſenſible of that great loſſe, and to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly humbled for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hereby ſheweth us our duty what we ought to do.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hereby we are put in mind to uſe the right remedy <hi>(i. e.)</hi> going to Jeſus Chriſt for ſtrength of aſſiſtance; For through his ſtrength we can do our duties, and without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Let none therefore plead that they are not able to believe, nor repent, but though they are not able of themſelves, they ought to goe to Chriſt for ſtrength, for God hath laid help on one that is mighty, Chriſt is mighty to ſave, he it is that gives grace and glory. Let men examine their wills, are they not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come unto Chriſt, though life and ſalvation is tendred, yet they will not come unto Chriſt: they frame multitudes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, which their carnall hearts plead and reaſon againſt God. Chriſt offered to gather them, they will not: Chriſts offers to be their King, they will not be his ſubjects, they will not have him to reigne over them, unbeliefe and diſobedience are mens owne faults queſtionleſſe.</p>
                     <p>In the next place concerning Misbelievers, there are many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made by <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> they would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Believers, becauſe they believe one God Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but theſe reject <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they believe not in him. The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> preferre <hi>Mahomet</hi> before Chriſt. The <hi>Jewes</hi> believe him not to be come, now queſtionleſſe there is no true faith but that which hath Chriſt for its object, as we read <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> go further, they believe in God the Father, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they believe in Chriſt, but they joyne their owne workes with Chriſts Merits, for they joyne with Chriſt Mediation the Mediation of Saints, and Angells, and ſo they in a high degree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Chriſts interceſſion, <hi>For he is an Al-ſufficient Saviour, and the only Mediator,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. 1 Tim. 2. 5. But whatever <hi>Jewes, Turkes, and Papiſts</hi> may object; they will one day find all their deviſed worſhips, and misbeliefe to be abominable in the ſight of God. Likewiſe there are multitudes of looſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and formall profeſſors, they aske what need all this adoe? what
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116001:321"/> need ſo much faith? We perſwade our ſelves to be in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition already, becauſe we believe the Scriptures, thus many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves to be in a good condition, and think their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dtion to be happy, and yet follow thoſe very waies that lead down unto the Chambers of death. If all thoſe that have a good perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of themſelves had been true believers, then the <hi>fooliſh virgins</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 25. 10.</note> had not been excluded. Many ſay <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and Chriſt will ſay he knowes them not. Many will glory, and ſay that they have heard Chriſt preach in their ſtreets, that they have been in his preſence when he was upon earth, and yet Chriſt will not owne them. Farther yet, multitudes reſt contented with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith, an Hiſtoricall, and Dogmaticall faith, and yet all this while they arrive not beyond the faith of Devills, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, there are weak believers and theſe make many objections, and becauſe their Conſciences are tender, they ought to be dealt more tenderly with all.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, They object that they have no faith at all, becauſe it is <label type="milestone">

There is faith as little as a graine of muſtard ſeed: and yet it is accepted, <hi>Mat. 12. 20. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not breake, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgment unto victory.</hi> There are Chriſtians of the higheſt, of the middle, and of the loweſt forme. The man in the Goſpell had faith and doubting togeather, <hi>Mark. 9. 24. Lord I believe, help thou mine unbeliefe.</hi> The diſciples had a little faith, and yet this was true and accepted.</p>

                     <p>To draw downe the <hi>Context</hi> unto the <hi>Text,</hi> my <hi>Prophet</hi> is no idle Spectator, but he with <hi>Mary keepes all theſe things and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them in his heart,</hi> he makes a ſoveraingne Compound of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ingredients, and with the Laborious Bee, he ſuckes ſweetneſſe out of the ſowreſt herbes, and with <hi>Sampſon</hi> findes a honey comb in a Lions mouth: I meane he makes a dungeon a paradiſe, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding miſery, a ſuperabundant comfort by a wiſe and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall application, for come what will come his reſolution is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably fixt upon a principle of faith, that <hi>although the figg tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, and the fields ſhall yeeld no meate, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalles, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> Here is an enumeration of the choyſeſt comforts, ſuch as are of higheſt eſtimation amongſt men; The Fig-tree hath much ſweetneſſe, and brings forth good fruit, the fruit of the Vine makes the heart of a man glad, and oyle makes him have a chearfull countenance, and the field is ſo pretious, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>The King himſelfe is ſerved by the field.</hi> Moreover flocks in the fold, and herds in the ſtalls are of continuall uſe and ſervice unto man: weigh
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:116001:324"/> them together, and they will proove too light, they will fruſtrate thy hope, and renew thy feares and griefes. Let me inſtruct thee in this truth, that Gods owne people may be brought unto ſuch great ſtreights and miſeries, as all creature comforts may faile them. Now it's the time of their triall, for the time of miſerie tries the truth and ſincerity of their faith, when they are almoſt ready to ſinke and to be overwhelmed with ſorrowes, then moſt opportunely the Lord reacheth out a Cable to draw them out. In the moſt tempeſtuous weather, hope remaines the Anchor of their ſoules, be their hearts never ſo much over-clowded with ſorrow, they are revived by the joy of Gods reconciled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: It's God alone who is the ſupporter of the ſinking ſoule, they feele ſweetneſſe in God, ſurpaſſing the ſweetneſſe of the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, they feele refreſhings in him incomparably more delightfull then thoſe which the Vine and Olive affords, and they feed on food which the world knowes not of, even the bread of life, which yeilds more nutritive and reall ſuſtenance then all the flocks, and herds in the univerſe. The Lord is the Godly mans food, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, rejoycing, his only joy; God is all in all, nay better then all, unto him, Hee's a Portion, Treaſure, Rock, what not to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

But there is another Transformation, and that is of Faculties, and Qualities, as when men are changed from darkneſſe to light, from waies of ſinne and wickedneſſe to waies of holineſſe. When bad men proove good, and profane men become holy, when Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts become ſincere, halfe-Nominall Profeſſors become whole Reall Profeſſors, when from a forme there followeth the power of Godlineſſe, this kind of change is that Transformation mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Hence learned <note n="*" place="margin">Homo eſt formatus per Creationem, deformatus per culpam, Reformatus per gratiam, Conformatus per aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatus per contemplatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus per glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam. <hi>Goran. in Loc.</hi>

It's ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne that amongſt Philoſophers there are reckoned ſix ſpecies of Motion, and accordingly there are ſo many mutations. As for Inſtance there is a change in <hi>Generation and Corruption,</hi> and theſe are reduced to the Predicament of ſubſtance: Yet the ſame man whether alive or dead, hath the ſame integrall parts of leggs, armes, and thighs &amp;c. The carcaſſe of a man (although the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be gone was infinite) hath thoſe integrall parts, they are yet remaining. Another change is in Augmentation and Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now to change from leſſe ſinnes to greater is moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and to change from greater to leſſer is but a partiall-halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, altogeather rejected by God. Another change is in place, when a perſon removes from one place to another, yet he is one and the ſame man notwithſtanding; In caſe of bodily ſickneſſe, and diſeaſes, we know by experience that change of ayre, remooving from Towne to Towne, from one bed to another, doth not a whit remoove the diſeaſe. Likewiſe in caſe of ſoule diſeaſes, (which are moſt dangerous) change of place doth not produce amendment of life and converſation. As for ſuch (although their pretences be ſpecious) who betake themſelves to Cells, Cloyſters, Wilderneſſes, and relinquiſh humane ſociety, yet let them go where they will, to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, ſtill they carry with them <hi>a body of ſinne,</hi> a corrupt nature, in which are ſowne all the ſeeds of rebellion againſt God. Such as pretend out of conſcience to ſeperate from the company of the wicked, yet they keep company with one wicked man <hi>(i. e.)</hi> every one with himſelfe. <hi>Baſil</hi> an Eminent Greek Father being much troubled with the incurſions of daily corruptions which brake in upon him, reſolved to remoove from all company, and to live holily and retiredly in the wilderneſſe: But upon ſecond
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116001:337"/> thoughts he acknowledged, <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I carried with me my wilderneſſe ſinnes,</hi> and there I was haunted with my own hearts corruptions. The laſt change I ſhall mention (which only is to my purpoſe) is in Quality and affections and diſpoſitions. When ſinne and wickedneſſe are abominated, and the way of holineſſe is embraced; when there is a new frame upon the heart, and it's alter'd from bad to good, from ſinne to grace: this is that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which alone concernes our preſent diſcourſe.</p>

Such as are of excellent gifts and expreſſions, men of volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tongues are cryed up for Godly men, who notwithſtanding for all their gifts may be as meere ſtrangers to Regeneration as <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> was. It's ſad to conſider how many now adaies have abuſed their parts, and have bent their wits to coyne new opinions, and have borrowed from <hi>Gypſies</hi> a canting kind of language, uncougth and unſcripturall phraſes more befitting Poets, Stages, Players, Juglers then Preachers. And theſe are cryed up amongſt many for eminent Saints and converted perſons, whereas they never were acquainted with the great work of Mortification, known and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by ſuch as are Saints indeed. Let me tell you plainly, (for I affect plainneſſe of ſpeech) A man may be as great a Scholler as ever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> were: and yet be a meere ſtranger from the life of God, a meere <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in the Schoole of Jeſus Chriſt. Where ever parts are we may not envy the owners of them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we Idolize them. It's hard to taſt much honey and not ſurfet, and harder to have great parts and not to be proud of them. Indeed good parts are great advantages, and when ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified do abundance of good, but the greateſt learning, gifts, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116001:340"/> abilities and accompliſht parts may be in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Wherefore gifts and abilities are no infallible Characters of ſaving Converſion. The more parts any have, the more lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their accompt, and the greater is their ſinne, not to improove them to Gods glory; And the greateſt blindneſſe it is, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blind. And when men pride themſelves in the quickneſſe of their underſtanding, volubility of ſpeech, &amp;c. When as in the meane time they favour not the things of God, the myſteries of their ſalvation, what will become of all their parts? Perhaps God may take them away, or continue them as aggravations of their greater ſinne and judgment: becauſe they have a <hi>price put into their hands to get wiſdome, and are ſuch fooles as want hearts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove them.</hi>
